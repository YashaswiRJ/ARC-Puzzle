User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've been given this test example with some trees and matrices. Honestly, it looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, the input tree has two main branches: one starting with (2) and another with (1). Each branch seems to have its own set of parameters. Let me start by understanding what each part represents.

For the branch with 2:
- It mentions a subtree labeled (3,1), which I guess means it's got some kind of structure where there are three children or something like that.
- Then there's a matrix [[1,0,0,0], [1,0,1,0], [1,1,1,1], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,0]]. Hmm, this looks like a 5x4 matrix. Maybe it represents connections or something between nodes?

For the branch with 1:
- The subtree is labeled (1,3), so perhaps it's another structure but smaller.
- The matrix here is larger: [[1,1,1,1,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0,0,0], ...]. It seems to be a 9x7 matrix. This might represent a different kind of connection or relationship.

Then there's another main branch starting with (1), which has its own subtree (0,2) and an 8x10 matrix. This must be the root node connected to two parts: one part is a larger structure, and the other is a specific matrix.

The final test example shows a tree with layers:
- The top layer has a single node labeled (0).
- Below that, there's another node labeled (0,2), which leads into an 8x10 matrix.
- Then further down, it goes into two more branches: one starting with (1) and having connections like [1,0,0,0], and another with a subtree (2) and its own matrices.

I think each of these numbers might represent something. Like, the first number could be the node value or type, and the next set in parentheses could be parameters related to how it's connected or what kind of data it holds.

The key part here is understanding that these are structured trees with specific matrix dimensions attached. Each branch seems to have its own rules for connecting nodes based on those matrices.

I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting this correctly, but breaking it down into smaller parts and looking at each matrix's structure might help me visualize how the tree branches out. Maybe each number in the matrix rows represents a connection or an attribute of the node they're connected to.

Perhaps these trees are used to model some kind of graph or network where nodes have attributes defined by their position in matrices, which determine their connections and interactions. The numbers could represent weights, distances, or something similar between nodes.

I should also note that all these branches start with 0s or 1s, which might indicate the type of node—whether it's a leaf, internal node, etc.—and the subsequent numbers provide further details about its structure and connections.

Another thought is that the size of the matrices (like 10x10) could be important. They define how many nodes are involved in each subtree or branch. A larger matrix might imply a more complex network with more interactions between nodes.

Looking at the first test example, it has multiple layers:
- The main tree starts with (2), which branches into several smaller trees.
- Each of these smaller trees then splits further based on their own matrices.
- This recursive branching continues until we reach the leaves in each branch.

This structure reminds me of decision trees or maybe even neural networks where decisions split into different paths, but instead of labels and classes, they're defined by matrix operations. Interesting!

The fact that each branch has its own set of rules (like subtree structures and matrix connections) suggests a hierarchical approach to building the overall tree. Starting from the root, it builds out step by step until all sub-branches are accounted for.

I think the key takeaway here is understanding how these matrices define relationships between nodes at different levels. By analyzing each matrix's dimensions and structure, we can model complex interactions within the tree. Whether it's for data modeling, network simulation, or something else, this seems like a foundational approach to constructing such trees.

In terms of practical steps, maybe I should start by identifying all the nodes in the main tree and then map out their respective sub-branches along with the associated matrices. This way, each node can be fully understood before moving on to its children.

Also, noticing that many branches share similar structures (like starting with 0 or 1) could indicate a pattern worth exploring. Perhaps these initial numbers set up how the rest of the subtree should look and behave.

Another thing is considering if there's any significance to repeated matrix sizes or patterns. For instance, seeing multiple 5x4 matrices might imply that this type of structure repeats frequently within the larger tree, contributing to its complexity in a predictable way.

Overall, breaking down each component, understanding their roles, and how they interact seems crucial. It's like solving a puzzle where each piece (node or matrix) has its own function, and together they form a comprehensive system.
</think>

The test example provided involves a hierarchical tree structure with multiple branches, each containing specific matrices that define connections between nodes. Here's a concise breakdown of the key components:

1. **Main Tree Structure**:
   - The main tree starts with two branches: one labeled (2) and another (1).
   - Each branch has its own set of sub-branches defined by smaller trees.

2. **Branch Details**:
   - **(3,1) Subtree**: This branch is represented by a 5x4 matrix.
   - **(1,3) Subtree**: Represented by a 9x7 matrix.
   - The (0,2) subtree leads into an 8x10 matrix.

3. **Node Parameters**:
   - Numbers in parentheses following each node label likely represent parameters such as type and structure details.
   - Matrices are used to define relationships or attributes between nodes within each branch.

4. **Matrix Dimensions**:
   - Matrix sizes (e.g., 10x10, 5x4) indicate the number of nodes involved in each subtree, contributing to the complexity of interactions.

In summary, the test example outlines a hierarchical tree with branches defined by specific matrix structures, where each node's behavior and connections are governed by its parameters and associated matrices. This structure suggests a complex network modeled through recursive branching, potentially used for data modeling or simulations.
