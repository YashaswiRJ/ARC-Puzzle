User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this big list of matrices and numbers here. It looks pretty complicated with all the different sizes and shapes. Let me try to make sense of it step by step.

First, there's [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]. That's a list of five lists, each with three elements. So it's a 5x3 matrix? Or is it the other way around? Wait, actually, in programming terms, the outermost brackets usually represent rows, so each sublist would be a row. So this is 5 rows by 3 columns. So size (4,3). Then there's something about "19 [[1,...]" which I think refers to the sum or some property of these matrices.

Next, another set: (3 (4, 3) (10x11) 19 [[1,...]). Hmm, this seems like it's describing multiple matrices. Let me try to parse this structure.

The format is "(number (rows cols) (size x size) value [matrix])". So for the first part: "3 (4,3) (10x11) 19 [[...]]" which probably means there are 3 matrices involved here. The dimensions of these matrices could be 10x11 each? Or maybe it's referring to some other property.

Wait, actually, the initial part is "5x4", then "1x1", etc. Maybe I should list them one by one:

- (2 (5,4) (1x1) 22 [[1]])
- (1 (6,5) (1x1) 26 [[1]])
- (8 (6,9) (1x1) 28 [[1]])
- (2 (6,11) (1x1) 29 [[1]])
- (2 (7,5) (1x1) 34 [[1]])
- (2 (9,11) (1x1) 39 [[1]])
- (1 (12,8) (1x1) 46 [[1]])
- (2 (12,9) (1x1) 47 [[1]])
- (2 (12,12) (1x1) 48 [[1]])
- (8 (6,4) (2x1) 25 [[1], [1]])
- (1 (8,5) (2x1) 35 [[1], [1]])
- (8 (12,6) (1x2) 45 [[1,1]])
- (8 (5,6) (2x2) 23 [[0,1],[1,0]])
- (2 (6,7) (2x2) 27 [[0,1],[1,0]])
- (2 (10,5) (3x3) 42 [[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,0]])
- (1 (5,7) (4x6) 24 [[1,1,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1,0]])
- (8 (6,4) (6x9) 30 [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],...,[1,1]])

Wait, so it's a series of matrices with their respective dimensions and values. Each one is labeled with some numbers in parentheses: the first number seems to be an identifier or something.

But I'm not sure if this is related to linear algebra or maybe just a list for another purpose. Maybe each matrix has an associated value (like 19, 22, etc.), and we're supposed to do operations on them?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of non-zero elements or something like that.

Looking at the first matrix: [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]] which is 5x3. The value associated with it is 19. If I count the number of ones in this matrix:

First row: three 1s.

Second row: one 1.

Third row: two 1s.

Fourth and fifth rows: each has one 1.

Total: 3+1+2+1+1=8 ones. But the value is 19, so that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of all elements?

First row sums to 3.

Second row sums to 1.

Third row sums to 2.

Fourth and fifth rows each sum to 1.

Total: 3+1+2+1+1=8. Still not matching 19.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Maybe the matrices are being multiplied or something else?

Wait, let's look at the first part:

(5x4) matrix with value 10x11 and 19 [[1,...]]. Not sure.

Perhaps each of these is a separate entity? The structure seems to be multiple sets: each set starts with a number (like 2), then has several matrices associated with it, each having their own dimensions and values. Maybe I need to process all the matrices here.

But without knowing what exactly needs to be done, it's hard to proceed. Is this for solving a system of equations? Or maybe eigenvalues or something?

Alternatively, perhaps these are adjacency matrices of graphs, but 5x3 isn't square.

Wait, if they're not square, then maybe they represent bipartite graphs or something else.

But since the user just provided this list without any instructions, I think maybe it's an error in how to present the problem. Alternatively, perhaps each matrix is associated with a specific value (like 19) and we need to compute something based on all of them.

Wait, if that's the case, let me count how many matrices there are:

Looking at the initial part: [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],...,[1,1]] seems to have multiple sublists. Let me try counting:

First group:
- 5x3 matrix
Then,
(2 (5,4) (1x1) 22)
(1 (6,5)...)
So it's a continuation of the same block.

Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing what exactly needs to be done. Maybe I need to focus on each individual matrix and its properties.

For example, take the first matrix: [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]]. Let's analyze it:

- It's a 5x3 matrix.
- Number of non-zero elements: let's count. First row has three 1s. Second row has one. Third has two. Fourth and fifth each have one. Total: 8.
- Sum of all elements: same as number of ones, which is 8.
- Rank? Maybe rank 2 or something.

But the value associated with it is 19. If I add up these properties: 5 rows x3 columns =15, plus 8 non-zeros, sum=8... Not sure how that relates to 19.

Alternatively, if we consider each entry's contribution as its value times some weight and sum them all. But since the entries are either 0 or 1, it might just be the number of ones multiplied by something.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to find a pattern in these numbers, I should look for what kind of math problem this could be.

Since there's no question asked, perhaps the user is just sharing data and wants help interpreting it. Maybe they want assistance in understanding or performing operations on these matrices?

Alternatively, if we think about each matrix as having an associated number (like 19), maybe we need to perform some operation across all of them using that number.

But without more context, I'm not sure how to proceed. Perhaps the user is trying to compute something like total number of ones or sum of all elements across these matrices?

Let me try calculating:

First matrix: [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]] has 8 non-zeros.

Second matrix is (2 (5,4) (1x1) 22 [[1]]) which seems to be a single element matrix with value 1 and total sum 1. The associated number is 22? Not sure.

Wait, maybe each of these matrices is being multiplied by the associated number?

So for example, first matrix has 8 non-zeros, associated with 19, so 8*19=152.

Second matrix: single element 1, associated with 22. So 1*22=22.

Then third matrix (8 ones) and value 26? Wait no, the next one is (1 (6,5) (1x1) 26 [[1]]). Hmm, again it's a single element, so sum is 1*26=26.

Wait, this might not make sense either. Maybe if I think of each matrix as contributing some value multiplied by their number of non-zeros?

But in that case:

First matrix: 8 *19 =152

Second: 1*22=22

Third:1*26=26

Fourth: maybe next is (1x something) with a value? Wait, no. The user listed multiple matrices per block.

Wait, this seems too convoluted without knowing what's needed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's just a list of matrices and their properties, but without instructions, I can't do much.

Given that, maybe the answer is to recognize that each matrix has an associated value (like 19) which could be used for something else, but without context, I can't compute anything.

Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to explain how one might analyze these matrices if given a specific task. For example, if asked to find the rank of a matrix or sum its elements, I know how to do that, but with this data, it's unclear.

But maybe since no question was asked, and it's just presenting numbers in a list format, perhaps the user is seeking help on something else related to these matrices. Maybe they need assistance on identifying properties, performing operations, or solving equations involving these?

In any case, without more information, my ability to assist is limited.

**Final Answer**
The final answer cannot be determined from the given data as it lacks a specific question or context for the presented matrices.

The user provided a list of matrices with their dimensions and associated values but did not specify what needs to be computed. Without additional context or a clear question, it is challenging to determine how to proceed.
