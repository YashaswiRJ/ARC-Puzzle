User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this mathematical expression here that's written in a kind of confusing format. Let me try to parse it step by step. It looks like there are multiple parts separated by parentheses and commas, which might be matrices or vectors.

First, the initial part is "1 [1, 1, 1] ) (9 (0, 0) (17x17) 1 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], ... ])", which seems complex. Maybe it's a vector with several components.

Then there are other parts like "4 (14, 7) (1x1) 6 [[1]]", and similar structures. It looks like each part has numbers in parentheses, possibly indicating dimensions or specific elements. The last part is "3 [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]".

I think the main goal here might be to interpret these components as matrices and then perform some operation on them, maybe matrix multiplication or something else. Since I'm not sure what exactly is being asked, but given the context of these numbers and dimensions, it's likely about matrix operations.

Let me break down each part:

1. The first component: "1 [1, 1, 1]" – this might be a row vector with three ones.
2. Then "(9 (0, 0) (17x17) 1 [...])" – perhaps a 17x17 matrix where most entries are zero except for some ones in specific positions? The "9 (0, 0)" part is unclear to me.
3. Next: "4 (14, 7) (1x1) 6 [[1]]" – maybe a small matrix with dimensions 1x1 containing a single element which is 6?
4. Then another similar structure: "4 (14, 9) (1x1) 7 [[1]]"
5. Followed by "4 (1, 7) (1x2) 3 [[1, 1]]" – this could be a 1x2 matrix with three elements?
6. Another one: "4 (9, 7) (1x2) 5 [[1, 1]]"
7. Finally: "4 (7, 1) (3x3) 4 [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]" – this seems like a 3x3 matrix.

Putting it all together, maybe these components are building up some larger matrices or tensors. Perhaps the first part is constructing a sparse matrix with ones in certain positions, and then combining smaller matrices into a bigger one.

Looking at the last section: "3 [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]" – this could be a 3x3 zero matrix. So maybe all these pieces are being assembled to form a single matrix or a set of matrices.

I think the key here is that each part defines a specific block within a larger matrix structure. The numbers like (17x17) indicate the size, and the positions where ones are placed define how they fit together. The zeros would fill in the remaining spaces.

So perhaps this is constructing a large sparse matrix with multiple blocks of ones at specified positions. Then, once the entire matrix is constructed, maybe there's an operation to perform on it, like matrix multiplication or calculating its determinant.

Alternatively, if I consider each part separately and perform operations on them individually, but given that they're separated by commas without any operators, it might just be about building a composite structure from these components.

Given the complexity and multiple parts with different dimensions (from 17x17 down to 3x3), I suspect this is about constructing an adjacency matrix or some kind of graph representation where each submatrix corresponds to connections between nodes. The ones indicate edges, and zeros mean no connection.

If that's the case, then perhaps after assembling all these blocks into a larger matrix, we could analyze its properties like connectivity, eigenvalues, etc., but without more specific instructions, it's hard to say exactly what operation is needed.

Alternatively, maybe each of these components represents different adjacency matrices for subgraphs, and combining them would give the overall adjacency matrix. Then, perhaps we need to find something like the number of edges or perform a union operation on all these subgraphs.

Another possibility is that this structure represents some kind of layered graph where each layer corresponds to one of these blocks, and connections between layers are defined by the ones in specific positions.

I think I might need more context to determine exactly what's being asked. But if I have to make an assumption, it's about building a large adjacency matrix from smaller components with specified ones and zeros, possibly representing edges in a graph structure.

In that case, maybe the final step would be to compute some property of this matrix, such as its trace, determinant, rank, or eigenvalues. Since the last part is a 3x3 zero matrix, if it's part of a larger structure, perhaps the overall matrix has certain properties based on these blocks.

But honestly, without knowing exactly what the task is, I'm speculating here. The expression seems to be in a non-standard format, possibly from an old textbook or specific notation used by a particular author.

If I had to take action, my next steps would be:

1. Try to parse each component correctly into matrices.
2. Assemble them according to the structure implied by their dimensions and positions.
3. Perform whatever operation is needed on the resulting matrix, like calculating eigenvalues or determinant, depending on what's required.

Since I can't see any specific instruction after that, perhaps it's about just assembling the components into a larger matrix as per the given pattern. In that case, my answer would be to construct such a large matrix where each submatrix is placed at its specified position based on the dimensions and the presence of ones or zeros.

So summarizing my thoughts: The expression likely represents multiple smaller matrices with specific patterns (ones in certain positions and zeros elsewhere), which need to be combined into a larger matrix. Then, depending on what's needed after that, further operations can be performed. Since I don't have more details, constructing the large matrix is probably the first step.

To solve the problem, we need to interpret the given mathematical expression as a structure of matrices and then assemble them into a larger matrix. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Identify Each Component**: The given expression consists of multiple components separated by commas. Each component represents a block within a larger matrix. For example:
   - "9 (0, 0) (17x17) 1 [[...]]" likely represents a 17x17 matrix with specific ones and zeros.
   - Similarly, other components like "4 (14, 7) (1x1) 6 [[1]]", etc., represent smaller matrices.

2. **Assemble the Larger Matrix**: Each component corresponds to a block in the larger matrix at its specified position. For instance:
   - The first block is a 17x17 matrix.
   - Subsequent blocks are placed at specific positions as indicated by their dimensions (e.g., (14,7), (9,7), etc.).

3. **Construct the Matrix**: Fill in each block with ones and zeros according to the given patterns. The "1 [[...]]", "6 [[1]]", etc., indicate where the ones are placed.

After constructing the larger matrix, you can perform further operations as needed, such as calculating eigenvalues or other properties. However, without specific instructions on what operation is required, assembling the structure into a single matrix is a crucial first step.

**Final Answer**: The expression represents multiple smaller matrices with specified patterns (ones and zeros) that need to be combined into a larger matrix. After constructing this matrix, further operations can be performed as needed.
