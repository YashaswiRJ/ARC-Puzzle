User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've been given this problem with some examples involving trees and lists of numbers. At first glance, it seems a bit confusing because there are a lot of nested brackets and numbers mixed together in the input strings. I need to figure out what exactly is being asked here or what these structures represent.

Looking at the first example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] (3 (0, 1) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ) ...

This seems to represent some kind of tree structure where each node has children and possibly attributes. The numbers like 10x10 might indicate the size or dimensions, and then there are lists with various sublists.

The first thing I notice is that both examples have a lot of nested parentheses and commas, which makes it hard to parse manually. It's almost like a data structure representation in some programming language, maybe Lisp or something similar. Each opening parenthesis could be the start of a list or another structure, and the numbers within are elements or parameters.

Looking at the first part:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]) 

So this seems like it's describing a root node with value 0. It has two children: one is (0,0) which might be another node with value 0 and maybe parameters 2? Wait, the next part after that is:

(3 (0, 1) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )

Hmm, so perhaps each main element is a tuple where the first number is the node's value or something similar. Then inside, it has children with their own values and parameters.

Wait, maybe this represents a tree in which each node has attributes like depth or something else?

Alternatively, these could be nodes in a graph, with edges connecting them. The numbers might represent node IDs or some weights.

But the second part of the first example is:

3 (0,1) 2 [[1]]

So perhaps that's saying node 3 has children at positions (0,1), and it's connected to two other nodes? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe these are matrices. The 10x10 matrix in the first part might represent a weight matrix or adjacency matrix for a graph with 10 nodes. Then each subsequent number is another node with its own connections.

But then again, I'm not entirely certain without more context.

Looking at the second test example:

(8 (2,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]])

(8 (3,1) ... etc.)

This seems similar to the first one but starting from 8 instead of 0. The numbers like (2,4) could be coordinates or indices into a matrix.

The big difference between the two test examples is that in the second example, there's also something with 1x1 matrices and then lists of ones. In the first example, I saw [[0,..], ...] which are vectors filled with zeros.

Wait, maybe these represent Markov chains or transition matrices? Each node has a certain number of children (edges) determined by the numbers in parentheses. The numbers before that might indicate the size or something else.

But again, without knowing the exact definition of what each part represents, it's difficult to make accurate conclusions.

Alternatively, could this be related to tensors in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow? Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays, and they can have different shapes and operations. But I'm not sure if that fits here since there aren't any operations specified.

Another possibility is that these are nodes in a graph where each tuple represents an edge with some attributes. For example, (8 (2,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]]) could mean node 8 has an edge to node (2,4), which is connected through a 1x1 matrix (perhaps indicating a weight or transformation). Then the 2 [[1]] might represent two edges with certain weights.

Alternatively, maybe these are layers in a neural network. The numbers like 0, 3, 8 could be layer indices, and the rest of the parts describe the structure of that layer—input size, output size, connections, etc.

But without knowing how each part is supposed to be interpreted, it's challenging. Maybe I should try to break down one example step by step.

Taking the first test case:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0,...], ...] 

Assuming this represents a node with value 0 that has two children: another node with value 0 and some matrix. The subsequent lines are other nodes connected to it.

But perhaps each line is an independent subtree? Or maybe the entire thing is one big tree.

Wait, looking more carefully:

The first test example starts with (0 ...) followed by a series of tuples starting with numbers like 3,8,... So perhaps this represents multiple root nodes, each starting with their own number?

Or maybe it's just one main node that branches out into several subtrees? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the entire structure could be an adjacency list where each tuple represents a connection between nodes. For example, (0 (0, 0) ...) might mean node 0 is connected to node 0 with some parameters, but then there's more lines after that which are other connections.

But this still isn't very clear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's representing a graph where each tuple specifies edges and their attributes. For example:

- The first line: (8 (2,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]]) could mean node 8 has an edge to nodes at positions (2,4), with some matrix of size 1x1 and two elements in the list.

But again, without knowing what each part represents, it's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps these are instructions for building a tensor graph where each tuple specifies operations or tensor shapes. But that might be overcomplicating things.

Another thought: maybe these are nodes with multiple attributes. Each number before a comma is an attribute name, and the following numbers are values or indices into some data structures.

For example:

(0 (0, 0) ... )

So node 0 has two attributes, both set to 0?

Then next line:

3 (0,1) 2 [[1]]

Node 3 has children at positions (0,1), and it's connected to nodes with value 2 and a list of ones.

But I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers before the commas are dimensions or something else. Like (8 (2,4)...) could mean node 8 is in dimension 2 along axis 4? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps each tuple represents a position in a multi-dimensional array. For example:

- The first part: 0 (0,0), so maybe index [0][0]

Then the next line: (3 (0,1)...) could be another position within that array.

But I don't think that's quite it because there are other numbers involved like 2 [[1]] or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each tuple is a matrix multiplication operation. Like:

(8 (2,4) ... ) means multiply matrices at positions (2,4), resulting in an 8x8 matrix? But the next part says (1x1) and then [2[[1]]].

But without knowing how these operations are supposed to be chained, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe each tuple represents a node in a linked list or tree structure. The numbers could represent pointers or indices into another structure.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to Prolog terms with functors and arguments. Like (8 (2,4) ...) would be a term with functor 8 and arguments 2 and 4.

But then the next part: (1x1) might indicate that argument 4 has an attribute of type 1x1 matrix or something like that, followed by [2[[1]]], which is another list.

This seems too abstract without knowing the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe it's a representation of a state machine where each node has transitions based on certain inputs. The numbers could represent states and transitions between them with specific weights or conditions.

But again, I'm just speculating here because I don't have enough context about what these structures are supposed to model.

Perhaps another approach is needed. Since the user only provided these examples without any further information, maybe they're asking for an explanation of such a structure in general terms, like describing how it might be used or parsed.

Alternatively, if this is some kind of data format, perhaps JSON-like, but with custom syntax.

Wait, looking at the first example:

0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0,...], ...]

It looks somewhat similar to JSON arrays and objects. The numbers inside parentheses could be key-value pairs or array elements.

For instance:

- 0: an integer value
- (0, 0): a tuple with two zeros
- (10x10): perhaps a matrix of size 10x10
- 0: another integer
- [[0,...], ...]: nested arrays

But then the subsequent lines have more tuples:

3 (0,1) ...

So maybe each line is an element in an array? Or perhaps part of a larger data structure.

Alternatively, this could be a recursive or tree-like data structure where each node contains multiple sub-nodes with their own attributes.

Without knowing exactly what field this is from, it's challenging to provide an accurate interpretation.

Perhaps the best approach is to consider that these are representations in a specific programming language or domain-specific language (DSL), such as Lisp syntax, tensors in TensorFlow, or something similar. For example:

In Lisp-like notation, each tuple would be a list with the first element indicating the type and the rest being arguments or sub-expressions.

But even then, without knowing how to interpret numbers like 10x10 or (2,4), it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if we consider these as tensors in TensorFlow:

- Numbers can represent tensor shapes: e.g., [8] is a vector of size 8, [10,10] is a 2D matrix.
- Operations like matmul would multiply two matrices.

But again, the presence of lists and multiple numbers makes it unclear unless these are parts of operations in a graph.

Alternatively, maybe they're representing mathematical expressions with nested functions or operations. For example:

(8 (2,4)) could be an operation taking operands 2 and 4 to produce result 8, then [1x1] might indicate some matrix operation, followed by more operations like addition or multiplication as in [[1]].

But without knowing the exact rules of this notation, it's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps these are nodes in a Bayesian network where each tuple represents a variable with certain states and dependencies. For example:

- 8: node name
- (2,4): parents of node 8
- [1x1]: some attribute or factor type
- [2 [[1]]]: another factor involving variables 1 and something else.

But this is more guesswork.

Alternatively, these could be steps in a computational process where each line represents an action with certain inputs and outputs. For example:

Step 1: Take input (0, 0) to produce output (10x10)

Wait, but then the next step refers back to node 3.

This is getting convoluted without knowing what field this notation comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps these are steps in a recipe or assembly line where each tuple represents a task with inputs and outputs. For example:

Task 0: Take input (0, 0) to produce output of size 10x10

But then Task 3 refers to another step that takes certain inputs from previous tasks.

This could be the case in something like Makefile rules or a build system where each task depends on others.

But again, without knowing what this is used for, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps these are coordinates in space, with numbers representing dimensions. For example:

(8 (2,4) 10x10 ...) could mean moving from point (2,4) to a region of size 10x10 at coordinate 8.

But this is getting too abstract.

Wait, let's try another angle. Maybe it's an expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), where numbers are operands and tuples indicate operations with arguments. For example:

- "0 (0, 0)..." could mean push operand 0
- Then "(3 (0,1)..." could take the top two operands (0,1) and apply some operation (like add or multiply) to produce a result.

But then where does the "2 [[1]]" come into play? It's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps these are instructions for constructing a mathematical expression tree. For example:

- The first line: create an expression node 0 with two children both being 0.
- Then node 3 has two children at positions (0,1), and the result is an expression of size 2x[[1]].

But this still doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, if "10x10" represents a matrix multiplication of dimensions 10x10, then perhaps each number corresponds to a matrix in a chain. For example:

Multiply matrices: (8) = A*B*C where A is shape [2,4], B is size [10,10], but this seems off.

Alternatively, these could be steps in a linear algebra computation.

Wait, maybe it's about neural networks or computational graphs, like how dimensions are calculated at each layer. For example:

- Starting with two vectors (0, 0), multiplying them to get a matrix of size [10,10], then using that as input for another operation resulting in [[...]] which might be a tensor contraction.

But again, this is speculative without knowing the exact context.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe these are just random numbers and symbols used to test or represent something else entirely.

Alternatively, maybe it's an error code representation where each number corresponds to different states or operations.

Wait, if we look at "0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0" as lines in a program, perhaps they're setting variables:

- var1 = 0
- var2 = [0, 0]
- matrix = 10x10
- result = 0

But the subsequent numbers complicate this.

Alternatively, it's something like a state transition diagram where each tuple represents a transition from one state to another with certain parameters.

For example:

From state 3, transitioning via (0,1) into a new state of size [2 [[1]]].

But again, unclear without more context.

Wait, maybe these are steps in a recursive function. For instance:

- Call function at step 0
- Then call it at step 3 with arguments (0,1)
- The return value is based on the matrix product [1x1], but I'm not sure how that ties into [[1]].

Alternatively, perhaps these are steps in a tree traversal where each node has certain attributes represented by numbers. For example:

Node 8 has children at positions (2,4), and some attribute of size 1x1.

But without knowing the specific data structure, it's hard to say.

Another thought: maybe this is a representation of a mathematical expression evaluated step-by-step. Each line represents an operation or operand.

For instance:

Step 0: Evaluate 0

Then in another context (maybe in different variables): Step 3 evaluates (0,1) and produces [2 [[1]]].

But the presence of (10x10) makes it unclear if this is part of a mathematical expression.

Alternatively, maybe these are steps in a pipeline where each step depends on previous outputs. For example:

- Pipe 0 takes input 0
- Then pipe 3 uses output from another pipe at position (0,1), resulting in [2 [[1]]].

But again, this is getting too speculative without knowing the domain.

Perhaps it's best to consider that without additional context, these are either representations of some kind of data structure or steps in a process. If I had more information about what field they're from, like if they're for machine learning, compilers, or something else, I could give a more accurate explanation.

Since the user hasn't provided further details, maybe they just want to know how to interpret such notations generally.

In general, when faced with such structures:

1. Identify the notation system: Is it similar to JSON, mathematical notation, programming syntax, etc.?
2. Look for patterns or repetitions in numbers and symbols that might indicate functions, operators, or data types.
3. Try to see if these elements can be mapped to known constructs in their field of use.

Without more specifics, any attempt at interpretation would be speculative but could cover common possibilities based on standard notations used across various domains.

In summary, the examples provided are likely representations within a specific context—such as programming syntax for data structures or mathematical operations—but without further information, an exact interpretation is challenging. However, they can generally represent elements of data (like numbers), functions or operations with arguments, nodes in a graph, matrix dimensions, and so on.
