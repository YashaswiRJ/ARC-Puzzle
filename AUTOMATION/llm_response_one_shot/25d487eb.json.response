User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, I'm looking at this test example. It's a tree structure with nodes and their connections. The input seems to be in a specific format that includes numbers and lists inside parentheses. Let me try to break it down.

First part: (0 (0, 0) (16x11) 0 [[...]]). Okay, so there's a node labeled '0' with two children, both also labeled '0'. The number in the middle is 16x11. I'm guessing that refers to dimensions—maybe rows and columns? So it's like an array of size 16 by 11.

Then inside this first part, there are multiple lists: [0, 0, ...], repeated several times. Each list has 11 zeros. It looks like each node is associated with these arrays or something similar.

Next, the second part: (8 (14, 4) (1x1) 2 [[1]]). Hmm, so another node labeled '8' with two children labeled 14 and 4? The dimensions here are 1x1. Maybe this is a single element or just an indicator.

Then there's a list of eight zeros. After that: (4 (11, 1) (4x7) 1 [[0, 0, ...]]). So node '4' with children 11 and 1, dimensions 4x7. Then inside is another list of four arrays, each with seven elements.

This seems like some sort of matrix or grid data structure. Maybe it's for a game level or terrain where different tiles have specific properties based on their positions.

I think the numbers before the parentheses are node IDs, and the contents within define their children and associated values. The parts after the last parenthesis might be rendering instructions or data for each node.

To visualize this, I imagine each node has its own grid of values (like 16x11) which could represent different terrain types or object properties. The numbers in the grids might indicate certain features or attributes assigned to those tiles.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly these numbers and lists correspond to each other. Maybe it's hierarchical, where higher-level nodes contain lower-level data like their children and grid values.

Perhaps I should look for patterns or recurring structures. The first node has multiple child grids all filled with zeros, which might mean they're placeholders or default states. The second node (8) has a 1x1 grid with value 2, which is straightforward.

The third part starts with 4 and then an array of four rows each with seven elements, mostly zeros except for some ones in specific positions. This could represent different conditions or indicators based on position.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact application, but it seems like this structure is used to define a tree where each node has its own grid of values that influence how they render or behave in whatever system is using this data.

Maybe I should try to draw it out. Starting with root nodes and their children, then mapping their respective grids. That might help me see the relationships better.

But honestly, without knowing the exact rules for interpreting these numbers and lists, it's a bit challenging. It would be helpful to have more context or documentation on what each part represents.
</think>

The provided input is a tree structure with nodes having specific connections and associated values. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Root Node**: The first node is labeled '0' with two children also labeled '0'. This suggests a hierarchical structure where each node can have multiple child nodes.

2. **Connections**:
   - The root node (first '0') has 16x11 grid values, mostly zeros.
   - Its children are another set of nodes with their own connections and associated grids.

3. **Child Nodes**:
   - Node '8' is a child with two connections: 14 and 4.
   - Node '4' connects to nodes 11 and 1, each having specific grid values.

4. **Grid Values**:
   - The root node's grid has multiple rows (16) and columns (11), filled with zeros except for some sections marked by '1's.
   - Child nodes have grids of smaller dimensions (e.g., 1x1, 4x7) with specific patterns.

5. **Rendering Instructions**:
   - Each node seems to have rendering instructions or data based on its type and grid values.

In summary, the structure represents a tree where each node has its own grid-based properties that influence their behavior or appearance in an application.
