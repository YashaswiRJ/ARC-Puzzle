User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a series of examples with input and output trees, and I need to understand the pattern or transformation happening here. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at Train Example 1:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (8x8) 0 [[...]]) 

But the actual structure is something else. Wait, maybe focusing on the main components would help. Each tree seems to have nodes with attributes like size and values in brackets.

For example, the first input has a node labeled "2 (5, 2)" with a matrix [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[1,1,0]]. The output then is another structure: (0 ... ) with similar components but modified. Hmm.

In the Output tree of Train Example 1:
(0 (0, 0) (3x6) 0 [[...]]) 

So, it seems like when we have a node in the input, it's being transformed into something else in the output. Maybe dimensions are changing from 8x8 to 3x6? That’s a big drop.

Looking at the values inside:

Input matrix: [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[1,1,0]]
Output matrix after first transformation: [[0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Wait, that's all zeros. Then there's another part in the output tree with (2 (0, 0) ...). So maybe each node is being processed separately?

Let me look at Train Example 2:

Input Tree has a matrix [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]
Output tree after transformation: (1 ...) with another structure.

Wait, perhaps the numbers in brackets represent something like input channels or connections? Maybe it's about how data flows through nodes.

Let me try to see if there's a pattern between input and output matrices. In Train Example 1:

Input matrix is:
Row 0: [0,1,0]
Row 1: [1,1,1]
Row 2: [1,1,0]

Output matrix after first step in the tree seems to be all zeros.

In the second part of the output, it's another structure with a different matrix. Maybe each node is being replaced by a combination or transformation based on its input.

Perhaps there's an operation like summing rows or columns? For example, if you take the first row [0,1,0], maybe it becomes 1 (sum), but in output it's all zeros. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe each element is being multiplied by something. Alternatively, perhaps it's about how connections are made from parent nodes to child nodes.

Looking at the numbers outside the matrices:

In Train Example 1:
Input has a node labeled "2 (5, 2)", which in output becomes "0 ...". Maybe this represents some operation where certain values determine the new structure.

Also, the matrix size is changing from 3x3 to 3x6. So perhaps each row or column is being expanded into multiple elements.

Wait, another idea: maybe it's a convolution-like process where each value influences its neighbors. For example, in the first input matrix:

[[0,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [1,1,0]]

If we sum adjacent cells or apply some filter, perhaps that leads to the output structure.

But how does this relate to the output's matrices being all zeros initially? Maybe if no transformation is applied, it remains zero. But then later in the same output tree, another matrix appears which isn't all zeros.

Alternatively, maybe each node's value affects multiple positions in the next layer. For example, a 1 might set certain elements to 1 or something else, and 0s leave them as they are.

Wait, let me think about how many layers there are. The input has a (3x3) matrix under one node with label "2 (5,2)", then the output is another structure that includes (3x6), perhaps indicating more nodes or features being created.

Another angle: maybe each number in the main matrix represents connections to other nodes, and based on those, new values are computed. For example, if a 1 connects to multiple places, summing them could produce higher numbers, but here all outputs seem to be zeros initially.

But since there's an output with [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]], maybe the transformations happen in two steps: first making everything zero, then applying another rule based on some logic from the input matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is being split into multiple nodes, increasing the size of the matrix. So 3x3 might become 3x6 because each column splits into two columns.

Wait, looking at Train Example 1's output: (0 ...) followed by another structure with a different matrix [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]. That second part seems to be the same as the input matrix but with some changes. Maybe each row is being processed separately.

In that case, perhaps if there's a 1 in any position, it remains 1; otherwise, it becomes 0. But no, because initially, all zeros are shown, which might mean that without transformation, it stays zero.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers (5,2) and (3,6) indicate how many connections or branches occur from each node, affecting the size of the matrix.

This is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should consider this as a type of graph transformation where nodes are processed based on their incoming edges and produce outgoing edges accordingly.

If that's the case, perhaps each '1' in the input matrix indicates an active connection, which is then used to determine the structure in the output. So if a node has certain connections (1s), it triggers specific patterns in the next layer.

Looking at the first example, after processing, all elements become zero. Then later, another transformation occurs where some 1s are preserved. Maybe this represents how information propagates through layers, with active connections ('1's) passing values to the next nodes, which then determine their outputs.

Alternatively, maybe each number in the main matrix is being used as a coefficient or mask applied during the transformation. For example, multiplying elements and summing them up could produce new values, but again, since we're seeing zeros initially, it might be that active connections are leading to certain patterns.

Wait, another thought: perhaps these structures represent neural network layers where each node is an artificial neuron with inputs from other neurons. The numbers in the matrix indicate how much each input affects the output, and based on some activation function (like ReLU), we get either zero or a value.

In that case, if all inputs are non-negative, and using an activation function that sets everything to zero except when above a threshold, which might result in zeros. But then why does another part have 1s?

Alternatively, maybe it's just matrix multiplication followed by element-wise operations like setting values based on conditions (e.g., if any input is 1, set output to 1; else, 0).

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe looking at both examples together can help.

In Train Example 2:

Input has a node with label "3 (something)" and matrix [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]
Output is similar to the first example but with different transformations.

Wait, perhaps each input number corresponds to how many connections or branches it sends. So if you have 3 in a node's label, it might split into three connections, affecting the output matrix accordingly.

But without more information on exactly what these numbers represent (input size, output size, etc.), it's challenging to be precise.

Alternatively, maybe each number is part of a formula determining the next step. For example, 5 and 2 in the first input could indicate multiplication factors leading to the new structure dimensions (3x6). So 8x8 might become smaller as 3x6 because some connections are being pruned or aggregated.

In that case, maybe each node's attributes influence how information is processed and aggregated into a different layer. The initial high-dimensional data (like 8x8) gets reduced to lower dimensions (3x6), perhaps for efficiency or feature extraction.

Looking at the output matrices in both examples:

- Initially zeros, then another matrix with some non-zero values.
- Maybe the first transformation is an aggregation step where all nodes are set to zero except those that meet certain criteria based on their input connections.
- The second part could be a more detailed processing where actual data flows through.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's value (the numbers in the main matrix) determines how its output affects subsequent layers. If any value is non-zero, it propagates; otherwise, nothing happens.

But I'm still not entirely clear on the exact transformation rules here. It seems like a complex graph of transformations where input nodes influence the structure and values of output nodes through some defined operations.

In summary, from these examples, it appears that:

1. Input matrices are being transformed into new structures with different dimensions (e.g., 3x3 to 3x6).
2. The numbers within the matrices seem to dictate how information is processed or aggregated.
3. Nodes labeled with numbers might represent activation counts or connection points.

To generalize, it's likely that each node processes its input data based on its connections and labels, applying some transformation rules (like aggregating, activating, or modifying values) that alter both the structure and the content of the output matrices. The exact nature of these transformations requires more detailed information about how the numbers in the input relate to the structures in the output.

Without a specific formula or set of rules provided, it's challenging to outline an exact step-by-step transformation process. However, based on the patterns observed:

- Input structure is transformed into an output structure with potentially different dimensions (e.g., 8x8 -> 3x6).
- Values within input matrices influence whether nodes are activated or contribute to specific parts of the output.
- Processed information flows through connections defined by node labels and matrix values, resulting in new structures.

It might be helpful to consider this as a form of graph-based transformation where each node's role is determined by its attributes and connections, propagating data accordingly. The transformations could involve either filtering out inactive nodes or aggregating data from multiple sources into more complex patterns.

Given the limited information here, it's challenging to pin down precise rules, but understanding that input structures are being converted into output structures with altered dimensions based on some transformation logic involving node attributes and their connections seems like a reasonable starting point.

If I had to make an educated guess, perhaps each non-zero value in the input matrix propagates its data through connected nodes, leading to the formation of new edges or nodes in the output structure. Active nodes (those with non-zero values) would determine how information is combined and structured into higher-level nodes, which could then produce the observed outputs.

In any case, without more specific details on the transformation rules, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation. However, based on the examples provided, it's evident that these transformations involve processing input data through layers of nodes with connections defined by their labels and values, resulting in new structured outputs.
</think>

The problem involves understanding complex graph-based transformations where input structures are converted into output structures with altered dimensions. The transformation rules are not explicitly detailed but can be inferred to involve the following key points:

1. **Input Structure Transformation**: Input matrices undergo structural changes from higher dimensions (e.g., 8x8) to lower dimensions (e.g., 3x6). This suggests a form of dimensionality reduction or feature extraction.

2. **Node Processing Rules**: Nodes are labeled with numbers indicating their role and connections. Values within input matrices dictate how information is processed, potentially activating nodes based on non-zero values or propagating data through connected nodes.

3. **Data Propagation**: Non-zero values in the matrix influence whether nodes are activated or contribute to specific parts of the output. This propagation could lead to the formation of new edges or nodes in the output structure.

4. **Aggregation and Filtering**: Inactive nodes (those with zero values) might be filtered out, while active nodes aggregate data, contributing to the formation of higher-level nodes in the output.

In summary, the transformation involves processing input data through layers of nodes with connections defined by their attributes, resulting in new structured outputs with altered dimensions. The exact rules require more detailed information on how node labels and matrix values influence transformations, but key elements include structural changes, activation based on non-zero values, and data propagation through connected nodes.
