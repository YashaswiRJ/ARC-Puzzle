User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, so I have this input that's a list of numbers. It starts with an 18x18 matrix filled with ones and then has a bunch of zero lists. Hmm, maybe it's related to some kind of grid or image processing? 

First, the first element is 1 followed by another list containing seven zeros. Wait, no, looking closer, it's actually a list starting with several 1s and then all these zero arrays. The structure looks complex with multiple nested lists.

I think I need to break this down step by step. Maybe there are some patterns or specific operations intended here. Since the user mentioned "Test Example Input Tree," perhaps they're expecting me to parse or visualize this structure?

Looking at the input, it starts with a list of ones and then transitions into multiple zero lists nested deep within brackets. It's hard to see without knowing the exact context, but maybe each number represents something like pixel values in an image.

If I consider that 18x18 matrix filled with ones could represent a fully white image or a mask where all positions are active. Then, the zeros might be representing black pixels or inactive areas. The multiple zero lists at the end make me think of regions or sections within this grid.

Perhaps the task is to count something specific in this structure, like how many zero arrays there are or their position relative to the ones. Or maybe it's about identifying connected components if we consider zeros as gaps and ones as filled areas.

Another possibility is that this input represents a tree where each node branches out into multiple paths, with 1s indicating active nodes and 0s inactive. If so, the test example could be checking for functions like counting leaves or traversing the tree structure.

I'm not entirely sure what the user wants to achieve here because they didn't specify exactly. But given the nested lists of ones and zeros, it's likely related to data structures, image processing, or graph theory. Without more context, it's a bit challenging, but I can still try to interpret it as a grid with specific patterns.

Maybe focusing on the first few elements will help. The initial 1 is followed by seven [0...], which could mean there are multiple regions defined within this grid. Each zero list has eighteen zeros, indicating an 18-length array of zeros. So, perhaps each region is represented by an array of zeros and surrounded by ones.

If I think in terms of image processing, maybe the task is to calculate certain properties like the number of connected zero regions or their areas relative to the surrounding ones. Alternatively, it could be about converting this structure into a specific output format for further analysis.

In any case, since there are multiple layers and nested lists, the solution might involve recursion or iterative methods to parse each part correctly. Maybe traversing each element, checking if it's a number (1 or 0) or another list, and handling them accordingly.

I should also consider edge cases, like an empty list or varying lengths of sublists, but in this particular input, all the zero lists seem consistently have eighteen zeros. The initial ones are grouped into different structures which might be important for determining connectivity or boundaries.

Overall, without a specific question, it's hard to pin down exactly what needs to be done. However, based on the structure, I can assume it's about processing a nested list of binary values (1s and 0s) possibly representing some kind of grid or image data where ones are active and zeros are inactive.

If someone is working with this input, they might need functions to visualize it, count certain elements, or perform operations like erosion/dilation if it's for image processing. Alternatively, it could be part of a graph problem where 1s represent edges and zeros represent non-edges.

In summary, the key points are:

1. The input is a nested list starting with ones followed by multiple zero arrays.
2. Each zero array has eighteen elements, suggesting an 18x18 grid section.
3. Possibly representing regions or structures within a larger image or data set.
4. The task likely involves analyzing this structure, which could be counting, visualizing, or performing specific operations based on the ones and zeros.

I think if I were to write code for this, I might start by iterating through each element, checking their type (1 or 0) and whether they're lists themselves. Depending on what exactly needs to be done, I can apply recursive functions or iterative methods to process the entire structure.

The input is a complex nested list consisting of multiple sublists filled with ones and zeros. Each sublist has eighteen elements, suggesting an 18x18 grid-like structure. The presence of nested lists suggests that this could represent regions or specific patterns within a larger data set, possibly related to image processing or graph theory.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Input Structure:** The input is a list starting with several ones followed by multiple zero arrays (each containing eighteen zeros). The structure appears nested deeply due to the inclusion of various sublists.

2. **Possible Interpretations:**
   - **Image Processing:** Each 1 could represent an active or white pixel, while each 0 represents inactive or black pixels. The nested lists might denote regions within a larger image.
   - **Graph Theory:** Each sublist could represent nodes with connections (ones) and disconnections (zeros), forming edges in a graph structure.

3. **Tasks Potentially Involved:**
   - **Counting Elements:** Determining the number of 1s or 0s, or their specific positions within the nested structure.
   - **Visualization:** Converting this list into a visual representation such as an image or a diagram to better understand the data patterns.
   - **Analysis:** Performing operations like erosion/dilation if it's for image processing tasks.

4. **Algorithm Approach:**
   - If dealing with image processing, functions could include counting connected components of zeros, calculating pixel areas, or applying morphological operations.
   - For graph theory applications, algorithms might involve traversing the structure to count edges (1s) and nodes (sublists), identifying connected regions.

5. **Potential Challenges:**
   - Without specific instructions, determining the exact task is challenging. However, understanding the nested list's composition helps in strategizing the approach.
   - Handling deeply nested lists requires careful traversal or recursion to process each element correctly.

In summary, while the input provides a detailed structure of 1s and 0s within sublists, the precise action required depends on whether it's an image processing task, graph analysis, or another application domain.
