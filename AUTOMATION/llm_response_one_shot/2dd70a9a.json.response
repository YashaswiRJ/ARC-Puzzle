User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to work with some kind of tree structure and matrices. The input is a bit complicated with all these numbers and arrays inside parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the initial part is [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This looks like an array of length 10 with mostly zeros and a few ones. Then there's another array: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is also length 10 but starts with two ones.

Next, the test example input tree has several parts. It starts with (0 (0, 0) (13x13) 0 [[0, 0, ..., 0], ...]). Hmm, okay, so this seems like a node with value 0, and it's connected to another node which is a 13x13 matrix. Then there are some other nodes following the same pattern.

I notice that each of these tree components has elements in parentheses: (value (left right) size [[matrix]]) or something similar. Maybe each component represents a node with some children, where the value is either part of a matrix or another node's value?

Looking at the first example input: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and then [[0,0,...], [0,0,...]]. So perhaps this represents a structure where there are two matrices attached to it. One is the first array with three zeros at the end? Wait, no, both arrays have length 10.

Wait, maybe each node can be either a scalar value or a matrix, and these nodes are connected in a tree. The initial input might be representing multiple nodes in this tree structure that I need to process.

I'm also seeing some numbers like (8 (3,8) (1x1) 5 [[1]]), which seems like another node with value 8, left child 3 and right child 8, size is 1x1 matrix, and a single child node with the value 5 and matrix [1]. So maybe each component represents a subtree where nodes have values and associated matrices.

The problem statement isn't entirely clear to me. I'm not sure what exactly needs to be computed or outputted based on this input. It might involve some kind of tree traversal, matrix operations like multiplication or addition, or perhaps building the tree structure and processing each node accordingly.

Since the initial part has two arrays with zeros and ones, maybe it's about creating a path where 1s represent connections and 0s are dead ends? Or perhaps these matrices are adjacency matrices for some kind of graph representation in the tree.

I think I need to figure out what the problem is asking exactly. Given the complexity of the input, it's likely that we're supposed to parse this structure into a tree or another format and then perform operations on it based on some rules. Without more context, though, it's hard to know for sure.

Maybe each node can be processed recursively, handling both scalar values and matrices. For example, nodes with 0 might represent leaves, while non-zero nodes have children represented by the arrays following them.

Wait, looking at the initial part again: [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]. This is a list of ten elements, perhaps representing connections or something. Then [[0,..], [0,...]] which might be two matrices each with 5 rows (since there are five sub-arrays). But actually, both arrays have length 10, so maybe they're 2x10? Not sure.

The test example's tree has multiple components: some with value 8 and children like left child as another node, right child is a single element or matrix. So perhaps the main structure is a collection of nodes that form a forest (a set of trees), each node having its own properties.

Given all this, I think my task is to parse this input into a tree data structure where each node can have attributes like value and matrices associated with it, then perform operations on them based on some rules. But since the specific problem isn't detailed, maybe the goal is just to convert this input format into something more readable or processable.

I need to figure out how to represent these nodes in code. Maybe using a class for each node that holds its value and children. Each child can be another node or perhaps an array representing a matrix. Then I can traverse this tree, maybe calculate some property like the sum of all matrices' elements, or check connectivity based on 1s.

But without knowing exactly what needs to be computed, it's difficult to proceed. Perhaps there's more context missing, or maybe the problem is part of a larger set where these inputs are processed in specific ways.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. Parse the input string into its constituent nodes and matrices.
2. Represent each node with its value and any associated children (matrices or other nodes).
3. Traverse the tree structure to perform necessary operations based on defined rules.
4. Output the result accordingly.

However, without clear instructions on what operations are needed, I'm just speculating here. Maybe if this is part of a code golf problem or something similar, where each node has specific properties, then perhaps it's about counting the number of 1s in all matrices attached to nodes with value greater than zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's about building an adjacency list from these connections and computing some graph metric like connected components. But again, not sure.

Given that, I think my best bet is to focus on parsing the structure correctly into a tree where each node contains its children as per the input, along with any associated matrices or scalar values. Once parsed, if needed, perform operations based on typical tree problems, such as counting nodes of a certain type, summing matrix elements, etc.

So, I'll try to write some pseudocode for parsing this:

Start by initializing an empty list for all nodes.
Parse the input string, splitting it into tokens.
Iterate through the tokens:
   When encountering a node definition (e.g., (value ... )), create a new node object.
   Add its value and any attached matrices or children to the node's properties.
   Recursively parse any nested structures within the children.

Once parsed, depending on what needs to be done, process each node accordingly. Since I don't have specific instructions, maybe it's just building this structure for further processing.

Alternatively, if the goal is to count something in the matrices attached to certain nodes, perhaps iterate through each matrix and sum up their elements based on conditions related to the node's value.

But since I can't do actual coding here, I'll stop at understanding how to represent it. Maybe with this structure, further processing becomes manageable.

The problem involves parsing a complex input into a tree-like structure where nodes have values and associated matrices or arrays. The goal is likely to process these structures for operations like summing matrix elements or analyzing connectivity based on 1s in the arrays.

**Answer:**

The initial part of the input contains two arrays with zeros and ones, possibly representing connections or binary states within a tree structure. Each subsequent component represents a node in a tree where values can be scalars or matrices. Parsing this into a structured format allows for processing each node's properties recursively. 

For instance, nodes with value 8 have children which could be other nodes or single values. Matrices attached to nodes may represent relationships or weights between connections.

Without specific instructions on the required output, the focus is on correctly parsing and representing the tree structure:

1. **Parsing**: Convert the input string into a tree where each node contains its value and any associated matrices or children.
2. **Representation**: Use objects or classes for each node to hold their properties, allowing recursive traversal.

This structured approach enables further processing such as summing matrix elements, analyzing connectivity, or other defined operations based on specific problem requirements.

The final answer involves correctly parsing the input into a tree structure, facilitating subsequent operations on its nodes and associated matrices.
