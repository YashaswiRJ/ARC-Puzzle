User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It seems like there's some kind of tree structure involved with matrices or something similar. The input is a tree where each node has children and possibly some matrix associated with it. The output example shows that the matrices are being transformed in some way.

First, looking at the train examples: both have an input tree and an output tree. I need to see what changes from the input to the output. Let me compare them.

In Train Example 1:
- Input has a node labeled (5x5) which is probably a matrix size.
- One child is (2,1), another is (3,0). The outputs for these change their sizes or values.

Wait, in the output, that same (3,0) node now becomes [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]. So instead of being a scalar (maybe size?), it's a matrix. Hmm.

Looking at another part: in the input, after the two children from the first node, there are three leaves with values [[1]], [[2]], and a 5x5 matrix. In the output, these become different matrices. The [[1]] becomes [[0,1]], which is [something], but wait no—it's now part of a larger structure.

Wait, maybe each leaf in the tree has some transformation applied to it based on its position or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the operations are being rearranged or merged into other nodes.

I'm not quite sure what's going on here. Maybe I should try to see if there's a pattern in how the matrices change from input to output.

Looking at Train Example 1:

Input Matrix after children:
- [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output Matrix after children:
- [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]

Wait, that's a 2x5 matrix now instead of 5x5. So the size has changed from (3,0) to (2,5). Also, the values are different.

Another part in input is [[1]] and output becomes something else? No, looking at Train Example 1 Output tree: for node labeled (4,1), it's [[1]], same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each child of a node has its matrix processed differently based on some rule.

Maybe the parent nodes are aggregating their children's matrices in some way—like concatenation or transposition?

Looking at another part:

In the input, one child is (2, 3) with value [[0,1,0,1,0], [1,1,1,1,1]]. In the output, this becomes [[0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,0,1]].

So it's changed from a matrix where all ones in the second row to something else. Wait, maybe flipping some elements?

Alternatively, perhaps each leaf node is being transformed based on its parent or sibling nodes.

I'm not exactly sure what rules are governing these transformations. Maybe I need more information or examples to figure out the pattern.

Perhaps the key is that for certain child nodes (those labeled with numbers), their matrix values are being modified in specific ways—maybe flipping bits, reordering rows/columns, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of how the matrices are structured. For instance, in the output trees, some children have been promoted to be leaves themselves rather than parents.

Wait, looking at Train Example 1 Output:

One node has (2x5) and two children: [[0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,0,1]]. So it's a matrix of size 2 rows by 5 columns. Similarly, another node labeled (4,3): its value is [[1]], which was previously [[1]] in input.

So perhaps when the child has a certain structure or pattern, it gets transformed into a specific type of matrix. Maybe if a leaf's value meets some condition, it gets replaced with a different matrix based on its position or something else.

Another thought: maybe each level of the tree is processed differently. For example, the leaves' matrices are being altered as they're passed up to their parents.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the nodes (like 2,1) represent operations applied to their children's matrices.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it would help to look for more patterns or try to think about what each part represents.

In the input trees:

Each node has:
- A label that seems to indicate its size as a matrix (e.g., 5x5), perhaps indicating the number of rows and columns.
- Some children, which can be other nodes or leaves with matrices attached.

In the output trees:
The labels for some nodes have changed. For example, 3,0 becomes [[0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,0,1]], so from a matrix of size (probably) 3x0 (which might be invalid or perhaps zero columns), it's now a 2x5 matrix.

Wait, maybe the label indicates something about the matrix dimensions. Like (rows, columns). So if a node is labeled (m,n), that defines its matrix as m rows by n columns.

But in the input trees, there are leaves like [[1]] which would be 1x1 matrices, but in the output, they remain similar or change.

Alternatively, perhaps labels represent something else. Maybe it's the number of nodes in a certain way? Or maybe each node is responsible for processing its children's data into itself.

Wait, another idea: perhaps when processing from input to output, some transformations are applied based on how many children a node has. For example:

- Nodes with two children might be turned into 2-row matrices.
- Nodes with one child might remain as scalar values or something else.

Looking at Train Example 1 Input:
- The main root node has three children: (2,1), (3,0), and another node which is a matrix of [[0,0,...], ...].

In the output, that same main root node now has two children with matrices:

- One labeled (4,1): [[1]].
- Another labeled (2x5): [[0,1,..],[1,0,..]].

So perhaps when moving from input to output, nodes with multiple children are being split into their own matrix representations. So for example, the node that had two children in the input becomes a 2-row matrix where each row represents one child's data processed in some way.

But how exactly?

In the second child of the root in the input was (3,0), which became [[0,1,...],[1,0,...]]. So perhaps it's transposing rows and columns or flipping bits based on its position.

Another point: In Train Example 2 Output:

One node is labeled (5x5) with a matrix that has mostly zeros except for the diagonal. It looks like an identity matrix but maybe shifted or altered.

Hmm, I'm not quite getting it. Maybe I should try to think about each part step by step.

Looking at the first part of Train Example 2 Input:

The root node is labeled (5x5). Its children are:
- One leaf with value [[1]]
- Another node labeled (3,0) with a matrix that has all ones in some rows and zeros in others.

In the output, this same structure changes so that the (3,0) node becomes an identity-like matrix: [[1,0,..],[0,1,...],[0,0,..]].

Wait, actually, looking more closely:

Output for Train Example 2:
- The root is still (5x5).
- Its children are:
   - [[1]]
   - A new node labeled (3,4) with matrix [[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]].

Wait, that last matrix looks like an identity matrix of size 3x3. So maybe the transformation is turning certain nodes into identity matrices based on their original labels?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a function applied to each node: for example, transposing if necessary, flipping signs, or something else.

But I'm still not sure what exactly is being done here. Maybe these are placeholder operations and without more examples, it's hard to tell.

Perhaps the key lies in observing how matrices' values change from input to output based on their positions relative to their parents or siblings.

Wait a minute, another thought: maybe each node's matrix is being processed by some function that depends on its position within the tree. For example:

- The number of children affects the size.
- The order of processing might rearrange the matrices into different forms.

But without knowing the exact rules, it's challenging to determine.

Alternatively, perhaps this transformation is part of a larger system where each node in the input corresponds directly to a node or matrix in the output through some encoding or decoding process. Maybe Base64 encoding? Or something else?

Looking at the specific matrices:

Input Train Example 1:
- A node has value [[0,0,...],[..]] and becomes [[0,1,...],[1,0,...]].

Wait, perhaps flipping bits: turning 0s into 1s and vice versa. Let's check:

In Input Train Example 1, the (3,0) matrix had a row of all zeros except for some ones; in output, it became mostly zeros with ones on alternating positions. Not sure if that's flipping.

Alternatively, maybe shifting rows or columns.

Another approach: perhaps each node's value is being converted into its transpose. So a 2x5 matrix becomes a 5x2 one. But not sure how that applies here.

Wait, let me look at the outputs more carefully:

In Train Example 1 Output:
- The (3,0) node became [[0,1,..],[1,0,..]], which is similar to an identity matrix but with swapped columns in each row.
- Perhaps a permutation of rows or columns based on some rule.

Alternatively, maybe it's being converted into a one-hot encoded vector. For example, if the original had three rows and zero columns, perhaps it's now converting that into two rows (maybe due to having two children) with specific values.

I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps each node in the input is being replaced by its matrix representation in the output based on certain criteria like:

- If a node has n children, it becomes an n-row matrix.
- Each row corresponds to one child's processed data.

But then how does the data get into those rows?

Looking at Train Example 1 Input:
- The root had three children: (2,1), (3,0), and [[0,..]].
In output, that same root has two children: [[1]] and a 2x5 matrix. So maybe only some of the original children are being processed into matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps nodes without any children become matrices, while others get split into their own matrix representations based on something like the number of children or their labels.

Wait, another idea: Maybe each node's value is being transformed in a way that depends on its label. For example:

- If it's (m,n), then m determines rows and n determines columns.
- The values within are somehow rearranged or calculated based on m and n.

But without knowing the exact transformation function, it's hard to say.

Perhaps I should think about the differences between input and output matrices for each node:

In Train Example 1:
Original (3,0) matrix had some zeros and ones; in output, it became a checkerboard pattern. Similarly, other nodes may have gone through similar transformations.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are being shifted modulo something or used as indices to place values.

But honestly, without more examples or knowing what these matrices represent, it's difficult to deduce the exact transformation rules.

Maybe if I think about what such a system might be trying to achieve. Perhaps encoding data in a way that allows for reversible transformations (like lossy compression), so each node's matrix is being processed and transformed into another form which can then be decoded back.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to matrix operations like multiplication or addition, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, looking at the second example:

In Output of Train Example 2:
- The (5x5) node remains the same.
- One child is [[1]], which didn't change.
- Another child became an identity matrix. Hmm, that seems significant.

So perhaps when a node has certain properties (like being labeled with numbers leading to an identity-like output), it's transformed into an identity matrix or another specific form based on some rule.

Alternatively, maybe nodes are processed such that if they have exactly one row and multiple columns, their data is rearranged into an identity matrix of the corresponding size. But in this case, [[1]] stayed as [[1]], which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another angle: Perhaps each node's value is being used to index or replace another part of a larger structure, but without knowing how these nodes interact within the tree, it's hard to see.

Alternatively, maybe each matrix represents some kind of transformation applied to its parent or sibling nodes. For example:

- The (3,0) matrix might be transformed based on its own data.
But again, not sure.

Wait, considering that in both examples, some matrices are being turned into identity-like forms. Perhaps the root node's value is an identity matrix and certain operations are applied to each child based on their position or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how many children a node has:

- If a node has two children, its matrix becomes 2 rows.
- If three children, perhaps three rows? But in example one, the root had three children but only two were represented as matrices.

No, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, another thought: Maybe each node's value is being converted into an adjacency matrix or some kind of graph representation. So a binary matrix indicating connections between nodes.

But again, not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe it's about encoding text or hexadecimal values into these matrices as some form of bitwise operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the matrices are being used to create certain patterns based on their positions (like diagonals for identity).

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe there's a simpler pattern here:

Looking at both examples, in each case, nodes that were transformed into matrices have values where each row alternates between 1 and 0 except for one position. For instance, the first example output has [[0,1,...], [1,0,...]], which looks like an identity matrix with rows swapped.

Similarly, perhaps other transformations are consistent across examples.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how many 1s each row has or their positions.

But without knowing exactly what these matrices represent (like, if they're for encoding data, probability distributions, etc.), it's hard to say.

Maybe the best approach is to try to see if there's a pattern in numbers between input and output. For example, looking at specific values:

In Train Example 1 Output:
- The transformed matrix might be created by some function of the original label (3,0). Maybe 3 rows, but with how many columns? It seems like it's now 2x5.

Wait, maybe each node is being converted into a one-hot vector based on their label. So for example, if the original label was 'm', n', then perhaps m becomes the number of rows and n becomes the number of columns in some way.

But again, without knowing the exact transformation rules, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the sum or product of elements within each node. For instance:

- The (3,0) matrix had a certain sum that translated into another value, but I don't see an immediate pattern.

Wait, perhaps each number is being mapped to its position modulo some base.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of binary: maybe numbers are represented as bits or bitmasks and then arranged accordingly.

But without more data points, it's hard to find a consistent rule.

Perhaps another strategy would be to consider that the transformation could involve replacing node labels with specific matrices based on some predefined mapping. For example:

- (2,1) becomes [[0,1],[1,0]]
- (3,0) becomes [[0,1,0], [1,0,0]]
But in the output of Train Example 1, it's a 2x5 matrix instead.

Wait, maybe each node is being converted into an m x n matrix where m and n are based on their label. For example:

- (3,0) would be a 3x0 matrix, which doesn't make sense as per the output.
Alternatively, perhaps it's a square matrix of size max(m,n), but that also seems inconsistent.

Wait, in the first train example output, after transformation, some nodes are represented with numbers: [[1]], which is just [1], maybe treated as a single element or 1x1 matrix. Then, other matrices have more elements arranged in specific patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's value is being expanded into its factors or multiples and then arranged into the matrix structure.

But I'm going around in circles here without knowing what exactly the system is trying to do.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe it's best to try to hypothesize based on common transformations:

1. Matrix Transpose: Swapping rows with columns.
2. One-Hot Encoding: Turning a number into a vector where only one element is 1 and others are 0.
3. Identity Matrix: A square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
4. Binary Conversion: Converting numbers to binary format within the matrix.

Given that in the second example, one of the nodes became an identity matrix [[1]], which is similar to a size-1 identity matrix but perhaps scaled up if it's larger.

In the first output, we see matrices with alternating 0s and 1s. That suggests maybe some form of patterned filling based on row or column indices.

If I consider that each row starts with 1 in a specific position:

Like for the (3,0) node in Train Example 1 Output:
Row 0: [0,1,...]
Row 1: [1,0,...]

That looks like an identity matrix but shifted. So perhaps it's an identity-like structure where only one element per row is 1, placed at a specific column.

If so, maybe the transformation is to create such a matrix based on some rules related to node labels or their position in the tree.

Alternatively, if each node represents a state and transitions are represented by matrices, but that's speculative.

Given all these considerations, I think it's best to conclude that without more context or information about what exactly is being transformed and how, deducing the exact transformation rule here is challenging. However, based on some patterns observed in the output matrices (like identity-like structures with specific 0s and 1s), a possible rule might be related to creating binary patterned matrices where each row has exactly one '1' at a particular position determined by node labels or their structure.

But since I can't verify this definitively, perhaps another angle is that these transformations represent some sort of encoding mechanism for the nodes. For example:

- Each node's label (m,n) could determine the size and content of the resulting matrix.
  - Maybe m determines the number of rows and n the columns, or vice versa.
  - The entries in the matrix might be determined by a function of m and n.

For instance:
If we have a node labeled (2,3), perhaps it becomes a 2x3 matrix where each element is calculated as something based on its position i,j. Maybe like A[i][j] = i + j or some other operation.

But without knowing the exact rule applied to generate these matrices from their respective labels, I can't be precise.

Alternatively, maybe each node's label determines a specific pattern in the matrix:
- (1,0) could become [1]
- (2,1) becomes [[0,1],[1,0]]
- (3,0) is transformed into a 3x5 matrix with a pattern of 0s and 1s.

But again, this is speculative. Without seeing more examples or knowing the exact algorithm used, it's hard to pin down the rule.

In summary, based on limited observations:

Possible transformation rules could involve:
- Creating binary matrices where each row has exactly one '1'.
- The position of the '1' in each row might be determined by node labels.
- Other possible transformations like transposing matrices or arranging elements in a specific pattern (like identity matrix).

But without more data, it's impossible to determine with confidence. Further information about what these nodes represent and how they're being transformed would be necessary to identify the exact rule.

Perhaps another approach is to check if there are common patterns or standard transformations used in similar contexts that could apply here. For example, in linear algebra, certain types of matrices have specific properties like identity, diagonal matrices, etc., which could match the observed output structures.

In the first example:
- The node (2,1) becomes a 2x5 matrix with two rows where each has only one '1' and rest zeros. It alternates starting from column 0: [0,1,...] then [1,0,...].

This might be an indicator that for a label (m,n), the resulting matrix is m x k (where k could be n or another function of labels) with each row having exactly one '1' and others '0's. The position where '1' appears in each row follows some pattern.

Similarly, the node (3,0) becomes a 2x5 matrix which also alternates but starts differently. Hmm, that doesn't align as clearly.

Alternatively, maybe the number of columns is determined by another factor beyond the node label, so perhaps it's based on the tree depth or something else.

Given all these complexities and possible interpretations without more context, I think it would be best to proceed with one of the hypotheses mentioned earlier. Maybe each transformed matrix corresponds to an adjacency matrix where certain connections are marked as 1s based on node transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps this is related to state encoding in a finite automaton, where each transition is represented by a matrix entry.

But honestly, without more information about what these transformations represent or the exact rules applied, any further speculation would be speculative and potentially incorrect.

The transformation of nodes into matrices appears to involve creating binary matrices where specific elements are marked (e.g., '1') based on node labels. The exact rule is not clear without additional context but may follow patterns such as identity-like structures or alternating positions in rows.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to determine how nodes labeled with pairs like (2,1) or (3,0) are transformed into specific matrices shown in examples.

2. **Observing Patterns:**
   - In the first example's output, a node transformed into [[0,1,...],[1,0,...]] shows an identity-like pattern but shifted.
   - The second example's matrix transformation includes an identity matrix and others with alternating 0s and 1s.

3. **Hypothesizing Possible Rules:**
   - Creation of binary matrices where each row has exactly one '1'.
   - Position determination based on node labels or tree structure.

4. **Attempting to Generalize the Rule:** Without exact algorithm details, possible transformations could involve:
     - Transposing matrices.
     - Creating patterns like identity matrices with shifts.
     - Arranging elements in a specific positional pattern based on input labels.

5. **Conclusion:** The transformation rule likely involves creating binary or structured matrices from node labels but without more data, the precise rule remains speculative.

**Answer:**

The exact transformation rules are unclear without additional context, but it's likely that each node is transformed into a matrix with specific binary patterns, possibly identity-like structures based on their labels.
