User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm looking at this test example provided. It seems like it's some kind of tree structure with numbers and arrays attached to each node. Let me try to parse what's going on here.

First, there are a bunch of lists inside the parentheses. Each one starts with a number in parentheses, followed by another set of parentheses, then more numbers or symbols, and ends with another set of parentheses. It seems like this format is repeated multiple times for each part of the tree.

Looking at the first line: `(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0, ...]])`. Hmm, maybe each number represents a node in the tree? The numbers inside the parentheses might be children or something. The "(10x10)" could mean that this node is connected to 10 parents and has 10 children? Not sure.

Then I see "0 [[0, 0, ...]]". Maybe 0 represents a value associated with that node, like its weight or something. Then there's another part `(2 (7, 2) (3x1) 4 ...)`. So perhaps this is another branch of the tree where the parent has two children: one at position 7 and another at position 2.

The "3x1" might indicate that each child has a vector of size 3 with one element. Then there's `[ [1], [1], [1] ]` which could be the data associated with those children.

I notice some patterns here: the first number after `( ... )` is often a count, like "2 (7, 2)" or "2 (4,8)". Maybe that represents how many branches or something. Then there's another part in parentheses with numbers and sometimes other structures inside brackets, which might be data arrays.

Looking at the second test example: it starts similarly but with different numbers. The first line is `(0 (0, 0) ...)` again, followed by a branch starting with `(2 (7,2) ...)`. This makes me think that each test case has multiple layers of these tree structures branching out from the root.

I'm trying to figure out what exactly I'm supposed to do with this. Since there are two test examples, maybe they're testing some function or algorithm's correctness? Perhaps it's related to tree traversal, data structure manipulation, or something else like that.

But without more context on what the expected output is or what transformation is being applied, it's a bit hard to know exactly what needs to be done. Maybe these structures represent something like a parse tree in programming languages, where each node has certain children and attributes associated with them?

Alternatively, could this be representing a graph structure? The numbers might correspond to nodes, the parentheses to edges or connections between nodes... Hmm.

I also notice that later on, there are arrays with 1s and 0s. Maybe these represent some kind of binary data attached to each node or edge in the tree. Perhaps it's related to machine learning where each node represents a neuron with certain weights (the 1s and 0s), but I'm not sure.

Given that, maybe my task is to parse this structure correctly so that another function can process it properly. Or perhaps it's about validating the structure of these trees against some criteria.

Another thing I see in both examples are nested parentheses with numbers indicating counts or dimensions. For instance, `(3x1)` and `(4x2)`. Maybe "x" is representing multiplication, like 3 by 1 matrices? So each number inside brackets corresponds to a dimension?

If that's the case, then perhaps these trees represent some kind of tensor structure where each node has tensors as children with specified dimensions. But again, without knowing what exactly needs to be computed or validated, it's tricky.

Wait, looking at the first test example: there are multiple parts like `(2 (7, 2) ...)` and other similar branches. Maybe this is a way of describing the shape or connectivity of nodes in a graph where each branch represents an edge with specific attributes?

Alternatively, perhaps these are configurations for a neural network architecture, where numbers represent layers, and the tuples inside are neuron counts per layer.

But I'm not entirely sure without more context. Since both test examples follow a similar pattern, maybe they're testing some kind of recursive structure or nested array parsing.

Perhaps each number is an identifier for a node, followed by its children in parentheses, then additional data attached to it. So the overall structure could represent something like a parse tree where each function call (number) has arguments and results attached as arrays.

Alternatively, maybe this is representing an abstract syntax tree with specific rules on how nodes are connected based on the numbers given.

Another angle: the way these test examples start with 0 or 2 might indicate different types of nodes. Maybe 0 represents a leaf node, while others represent internal nodes with children?

Given that, if I have to figure out what transformation is needed, it could be something like converting this nested structure into a flat list, computing some metric based on the numbers inside, or generating code (like Python) that can recreate the structure.

But again, without more information, it's hard. Maybe I should try to outline possible interpretations:

1. **Tree Structure Representation**: Each number represents a node with specific children and associated data arrays.
2. **Graph or Tensor Structure**: Nodes could be tensors with dimensions specified by the nested parentheses.
3. **Parsing Configuration**: Describing how to parse input into different parts based on numerical configurations.

Given these possibilities, perhaps I need to write code that can parse this structure correctly, handling both test cases and ensuring it works for any similar configuration.

Wait, if I look closer at the numbers in the brackets: `[0, 0]` or `[4]`. Maybe each of those represents a list of child nodes with specific attributes. So perhaps the tree is built such that each node has children defined by these lists.

Also, the "x" in "(3x1)" might indicate matrix multiplication dimensions—like a 3-row by 1-column matrix as data attached to a node.

Putting it all together, maybe this structure represents a tree where each node can have multiple children (as per the numbers inside the brackets) and has associated tensor data with specific dimensions. Each child is defined by another set of parentheses containing more numerical information about its own children or attributes.

If that's the case, then to process this correctly, an algorithm would need to parse these nested parentheses, interpret the numbers as node identifiers or data dimensions, and recursively build a tree data structure accordingly.

However, without knowing exactly what needs to be done with this data—whether it's visualization, computation, validation—it's challenging to provide a specific answer. But if I had to make an educated guess based on common problems involving such structures, perhaps the task is to parse these nested lists and convert them into a tree or graph structure that can be used for further processing.

Alternatively, maybe this represents some form of recursive function calls where each call has parameters described by numerical values, and each parameter corresponds to another set of function arguments. In that case, the purpose would be to simulate or execute such a recursive function based on the provided configuration.

Another thought: since both examples have multiple nodes with their own child counts (like 2 branches for `(7,2)`), maybe this is representing an expression tree where each node has two children and certain attributes. But in that case, why are there varying numbers like 3x1 or 4x2?

Wait, perhaps the "x" stands for multiplication factors. So `(3x1)` could mean a matrix of size 3 (rows) by 1 (column). Similarly, `(4x2)` is a 4x2 matrix.

If that's the case, then each node in the tree has some tensor data attached to it with specific dimensions, and its children are defined based on those tensors. Maybe this structure is used for something like neural network layers where each layer processes input tensors of certain shapes.

But again, without knowing what exactly needs to be computed or validated from these structures, it's difficult to know the exact steps needed.

Perhaps I should try writing code that can parse such a nested list format into a tree data structure. That way, regardless of what subsequent processing is done, the parsing step would correctly represent the hierarchy.

But since I don't have specific instructions on what needs to be achieved with these examples, my best bet is to outline how one might approach parsing and working with such a structure, assuming that each test case represents a recursive tree where nodes can have multiple children with their own attributes.

So in summary, even though the exact purpose isn't clear without more context, I think the underlying task involves parsing and constructing some hierarchical or graph-based data structure from these nested numerical configurations. The specifics would depend on what exactly needs to be extracted or manipulated from them.

To address the problem of interpreting the provided test examples, it's essential to recognize that they represent a structured format with nested lists containing numbers, which likely correspond to nodes in a tree or graph. Each node may have children and associated data arrays.

Given the complexity and ambiguity without specific context, here is an interpretation and suggested approach:

### Interpretation:
Each test example represents a hierarchical structure where:
- **Numbers** denote nodes.
- **Parentheses** define nested structures (children).
- **Data Arrays** within brackets represent attributes or connections.

### Approach:
1. **Parsing**: Develop a parser to convert the string representation into a tree or graph data structure.
2. **Analysis**: Understand if each node has children defined by numerical values inside parentheses and associated data arrays.

### Likely Use Cases:
- **Tree Representation**: Nodes with child nodes based on nested numbers.
- **Graph Structure**: Nodes connected via numerical attributes, possibly weights.
- **Tensor Dimensions**: Nested lists representing tensor shapes (e.g., 3x1 matrix).

### Solution Steps:
1. **Tokenization**: Break down the string into components for easier processing.
2. **Recursive Parsing**: Use recursion to build nested structures from parentheses.
3. **Data Structure Construction**: Create a tree where each node contains its children and associated data.

### Conclusion:
The task involves parsing and constructing a hierarchical or graph-based structure based on the provided format. The exact implementation would depend on the subsequent processing needs, such as visualization, computation, or further analysis of the parsed structure.
