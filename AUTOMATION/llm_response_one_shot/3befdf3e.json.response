User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this test example for a tree structure. Let me try to understand what's going on here. It looks like the input is in some sort of nested format with numbers and sublists. My first thought is that maybe it's representing nodes in a tree where each node has children specified by indices.

Let me break down the input step by step. The main structure starts with 0, which probably represents the root node. Then there are several parts enclosed in parentheses. Each part seems to represent a branch or subtree of the tree.

Looking at the first part: (1 (3, 2) (4x4) ...). Hmm, maybe this means that from the root node labeled 0, there's a child with label 1. The numbers (3, 2) might indicate something about its children—maybe it has three children of size 2 each? Or perhaps they represent dimensions or something else.

Wait, then I see [[0,0,...], [0,0,...], etc.] which is an array of zeros. Maybe this represents the structure of that subtree—the layout of how nodes are connected or arranged within that branch.

Next part: (3 (4, 3) (2x2)...). Again, starting with 3 as a label for another node and then some subarrays. This seems like it's describing another level down in the tree.

Then I see [[1,1],[1,1]] at the end of that section. Maybe this is indicating connections or edges between nodes? Perhaps each sublist represents a connection to another part of the tree?

Further down, there's (3 (1,0) (8x8)...). The 8x8 array seems significant—maybe it's the structure for an even larger branch with eight elements in both dimensions. Then I see multiple lines with [0,0,...] arrays again, which might be part of that subtree.

There are also mentions of sub-branches like (3 (2,2) (1x1)), [[1]] and others. This could mean nodes with even more depth or specific connections within those larger branches.

I'm a bit confused about the labels—like, does each number represent a unique node identifier? For example, 0 is the root, then there's 1, 3, etc. Each of these numbers probably corresponds to different nodes in the tree structure.

Also, the dimensions like 4x4 or 8x8 might refer to the size of some matrix or grid representing connections between nodes. Maybe each number inside the brackets represents a child node within that dimension? Or perhaps it's about how many children a node has at each level.

I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting this correctly, but it seems like each main part in parentheses describes a subtree with its own root label and then defines what kind of sub-branches or connections exist beneath it. The arrays filled with zeros could be placeholders indicating where nodes are connected or not.

It might help to visualize this as a graph, where each node has edges defined by these arrays. But without more context on how exactly these numbers map to the tree structure, it's hard to say for sure.

I think I need to figure out if there's a pattern in how the labels and subarrays are used. The root is 0, then we have children labeled 1, 3, etc., each followed by their own arrays which might indicate further connections or structures within those branches.

Maybe it's helpful to look at just one branch first—like the part starting with (8 (6, 6) (4x4)...). This could mean that node 8 has two children labeled 6 and 6, each of which is part of a 4x4 structure. Then within that, there are further nodes like 7 and 7 in 2x2 structures.

The fact that the arrays inside these sections have zeros except for certain positions might indicate specific connections or missing links between nodes at different levels. For instance, [1,1,...] could mean that each node is connected to its immediate neighbor.

I'm still not entirely clear on how this all fits together, but it seems like a complex tree with multiple layers and varying numbers of branches at each level. To properly analyze this structure, I might need to draw it out or use some kind of mapping tool to visualize the connections between nodes based on their labels and subarrays.

In summary, my approach is to parse each main section as a subtree, identify its root label, then look into its child nodes and their structures defined by the arrays. By breaking down each part systematically, I can piece together the overall tree structure from the given input.
</think>

The test example represents a complex tree structure with multiple layers of nodes. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Root Node (0):**
   - The root node is labeled 0 and has several child branches defined by subarrays.

2. **First Subtree (1, Child Nodes: 3, 2):**
   - This subtree starts with node 1.
   - It consists of four arrays filled with zeros, likely representing a 4x4 grid or connections within this branch.

3. **Second Subtree (3, Child Nodes: 4, 3):**
   - Node 3 has two child nodes labeled 4 and 3.
   - Each is followed by a 2x2 array of ones, indicating specific connections at this level.

4. **Third Subtree (3, Child Nodes: 1, 0):**
   - Node 3 also connects to node 1 with an additional layer defined by eight arrays filled with zeros, possibly representing an 8x8 grid or further sub-branches.

5. **Further Connections:**
   - Nodes like 7 and 7 are part of 2x2 structures within the larger subtrees.
   - The arrays filled with ones suggest immediate connections between nodes at each level.

Overall, this structure represents a hierarchical tree with varying depths and connections at each node, likely modeling some form of complex network or data structure.
