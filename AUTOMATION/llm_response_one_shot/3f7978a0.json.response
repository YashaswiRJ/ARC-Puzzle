User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to test this example with a tree structure. Hmm, looking at the input, it's a complex tree with multiple nodes and branches. The user provided an Input Tree in this JSON-like format, which includes various sub-structures like lists and numbers.

First, I should probably parse this input correctly. The main tree starts with a node that has children. Each child is represented by another set of parentheses, containing its own value, possibly more nodes, and so on. It looks recursive because some parts have similar structures, like [[0, 0], [0, 1]] which seems to be a matrix or something.

I notice there are numbers in the structure that might represent node IDs or identifiers. For example, seeing numbers like 8, 5, etc., and then branches following them with more parentheses. There's also some sub-arrays with zeros and ones, possibly representing binary values or states.

The user mentioned a test example but didn't specify what exactly they're testing. Maybe it's about parsing the tree correctly? Or perhaps analyzing properties of the tree like depth, breadth, node counts, etc. Or maybe it involves traversing the tree in a specific order to check for consistency.

Another thing is that there are sub-arrays with varying lengths, some have 13 elements, others have more or less. It might be useful to see if the structure maintains consistent nesting levels and if all branches close properly without mismatches.

I wonder if this structure represents something like a game tree or maybe an automaton where each node is a state or action leading to other states. The presence of 2x2 matrices with [1,0] and [0,1] could indicate transitions between states in two different paths.

Also, there's a part where the number 5 has children represented by lists of eight ones: [[1],...,[1]]. That might signify multiple branches each with a value. It's unclear without more context whether this is for counting, state tracking, or something else.

I should consider that testing this example could involve verifying that the tree is built correctly, checking for errors in nesting, ensuring all sub-arrays are properly closed, and maybe validating some properties like maximum depth or the number of leaf nodes. Alternatively, if it's a model for something else, tests might check functional aspects based on its structure.

I think I need to outline what exactly needs testing: parsing, structural integrity, functionality (if applicable), etc. Without specific test cases from the user, maybe I should ask clarifying questions or assume common tests that could be applied here.
</think>

To address your question about testing the provided tree example, here's a structured approach:

1. **Understanding the Structure**: The input is a nested tree structure represented with parentheses and sub-arrays. Each node can have multiple children, and some nodes contain matrices (2x2 arrays) or simple lists of ones.

2. **Parsing Validation**:
   - **Nesting Check**: Ensure that all parentheses are properly closed. This includes verifying that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
   - **Consistency Check**: Confirm that sub-arrays maintain consistent nesting levels and lengths, ensuring no mismatched structures (e.g., varying array sizes within the same level).

3. **Component Validation**:
   - **Matrix Structure**: Verify that all matrices are indeed 2x2 arrays with the correct format.
   - **List Integrity**: Ensure lists of ones have consistent lengths as per their definitions.

4. **Depth and Breadth Analysis**:
   - Calculate the maximum depth of the tree to understand its complexity.
   - Count the number of nodes at each level (breadth) to analyze branching factors.

5. **Leaf Nodes Check**: Identify all leaf nodes, which are sub-arrays with zeros or ones, ensuring they are correctly terminated.

6. **Functional Testing**:
   - If this structure models a state transition system, validate that transitions between states (matrices) are consistent and correctly represented.
   - Ensure that lists of ones appropriately represent required conditions across different branches.

7. **Error Handling**: Identify any anomalies such as unclosed parentheses or inconsistent array sizes, which could indicate structural errors in the tree.

By systematically applying these checks, you can ensure the integrity and correctness of the provided tree structure for further analysis or functional testing.
