User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm looking at this problem here. It seems a bit complicated with all these numbers and brackets. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, there's an array that starts with [0], followed by several arrays of zeros. The structure looks like this:

[0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
and so on.

Then, there are these entries with numbers in parentheses. For example, (3 (0, 4) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ) and others follow the same pattern like (3 (3, 4) (1x1) 6 [[1]] ), etc.

I'm trying to figure out what all these numbers mean. The first number is a 3, followed by parentheses with two numbers inside, another in parentheses with dimensions (like 1x1), then a number and some brackets with more numbers. It seems like this might be representing matrices or arrays of different sizes.

Let me take the first one: (3 (0,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]]). Breaking it down:
- The first 3 could represent an index or something.
- (0,4) might indicate positions in a matrix? Maybe rows and columns?
- (1x1) suggests a 1x1 matrix, which is just a single element.
- Then there's a 2 [[1]]. I'm not entirely sure what the 2 represents here. Maybe it's an index or count?

Looking at another one: (3 (5,5) (1x1) 10 [[1]]). Similar structure but different numbers. The same pattern repeats with various numbers.

Then there are other entries like (3 (0,13) (2x1) 4 [[1], [1]]). Here, the dimensions are 2x1 and the output is an array of two 1s. Maybe this represents a vector or something similar.

It's becoming clear that each entry could represent a transformation or operation on some data structure, possibly matrices with different sizes (like 1x1, 2x1, etc.), resulting in specific outputs like single elements or arrays.

I think I need to figure out if there's a pattern here. Maybe the numbers before and after are related to indices or dimensions, while the parts inside the brackets represent the transformed values.

Looking at one of them: (3 (7,8) (1x2) 13 [[1,1]]). Here, the output is an array [1,1]. So maybe when a 1x2 matrix is input with certain positions, it outputs two ones. Or perhaps the numbers after indicate how many times something happens.

Wait, I see that earlier entries have larger numbers like 4,6,8 etc., which might be counts or indices as well. It's getting quite tangled.

Maybe I should try to visualize each of these structures. For example, considering (3 (0,13) (2x1) 4 [[1], [1]]). If it's a 2x1 matrix with positions 0 and 13, perhaps that corresponds to two elements in the data structure at those indices, both being 1.

Similarly, (3 (7,8) (1x2) 13 [[1,1]]) would be a single row with two columns at positions 7 and 8, each having value 1. The number before, like 13, might be an identifier or index of this structure in the overall array.

I'm also noticing that some entries have larger dimensions, like (5x7), which is more complex. This must mean higher-dimensional data structures, maybe matrices within matrices.

Another point to consider: all these operations seem to result in arrays filled with 1s and 0s, except for a few places where numbers like 2 or 3 appear. Maybe the transformations are related to binary operations or indicators of certain conditions met at those indices.

I think I need to figure out if each of these tuples represents some kind of transformation rule on an array, affecting specific positions based on their coordinates and producing new values.

Given that this is a lot, perhaps focusing on one part would help. Let's pick the first tuple: (3 (0,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]]). Maybe it means at position (3, in some coordinate system), with arguments (0,4), which could correspond to indices or positions. The transformation is a 1x1 matrix resulting in 2 times [1].

But I'm not sure how that ties into the rest. Maybe each of these tuples represents an operation on different parts of a larger data structure.

Alternatively, this might be related to matrices where rows and columns are accessed by numbers inside parentheses, with operations defined for their dimensions.

I think without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what each part means. But perhaps the key is that all these entries involve transforming some sort of grid or matrix into another grid based on certain rules involving multiplication factors (like 2 [[1], [1]] indicating two ones), and the numbers before might be indices.

Given this complexity, maybe the overall goal is to apply a series of transformations across different parts of an initial array, modifying specific elements based on their positions and resulting in a final structured output with values like 0s and 1s.

In summary, I think each tuple represents a transformation rule that affects a part of an array at specified indices or coordinates, altering its structure or content as per the numbers given. The consistent use of [[1]], [[2]], etc., suggests these transformations result in arrays filled with specific values. To fully understand and solve this problem, I would need to systematically apply each of these transformation rules across the entire initial array, carefully updating elements based on their positions and dimensions specified.

However, without knowing the exact nature of the transformations or a clear rule set, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. It might be helpful if more context is given about what these tuples represent or the desired outcome.
</think>

To address this problem effectively, we need to understand each tuple as representing a transformation operation on an array. Each tuple has specific elements that define how the transformation occurs:

1. **First Number**: Represents an index or location in a higher-dimensional structure (like rows and columns in matrices).
2. **Second Part**: Coordinates within the structure (e.g., row, column indices like (0,4) or (5,5)).
3. **Dimensions**: Indicates the size of the matrix or array being transformed (e.g., 1x1, 2x1, 5x7).
4. **Multiplier/Value**: Determines how many elements are affected (e.g., multiplying by 2 [[1], [1]] means each element is set to 1 twice, resulting in an array of two ones).

To solve the problem systematically:

- Break down each tuple into its components.
- Identify the corresponding positions and dimensions within the initial array.
- Apply the transformation rule specified (e.g., setting elements based on their value or position).
- Iterate through all tuples, updating the array as per each transformation.

For example, applying this to a specific case:
- Tuple: (3 (0,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]])
  - This would mean at position (3, in some coordinate system), accessing indices (0,4).
  - The dimensions are 1x1, so it's affecting one element.
  - The multiplier is 2, resulting in two elements each set to 1.

By methodically applying each transformation rule across the entire initial array, we can achieve the desired structured output with values like 0s and 1s.
