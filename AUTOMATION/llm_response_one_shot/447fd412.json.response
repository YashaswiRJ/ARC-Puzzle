User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, let's see. I have this list of lists here filled with zeros. It looks pretty long, like each sublist has a bunch of zeros. Then there are these other parts with numbers and stuff in parentheses. Hmm, maybe those are dimensions or something related to matrices?

First, the main structure is a big matrix made up of smaller matrices. Each small part seems to have numbers attached like (2 (2,12) ...). Maybe that's indicating some kind of block or section within the larger matrix. The first one has 2 as the number and then (2,12), which might mean it's a 2x12 block? But there are more parts after that.

Then I see something like [[1]], maybe that's a submatrix with just a single element 1. There's also a part with [[1,1],[1,1]] and another one with [[1,0,0],[1,0,0],[1,1,1]]. These look like different matrices. I wonder how they all fit together.

The dimensions mentioned are things like 3x3 or 2x2. Maybe each block is a smaller matrix of those sizes. So the overall structure could be a larger matrix composed of these blocks in specific positions. The numbers before the parentheses might represent something else, maybe counts or labels?

I'm not sure how to piece this all together. It seems like there are different sections with varying dimensions and filled with ones or zeros except for some parts with other numbers. Maybe I need to visualize each block and then see where they connect in the larger matrix.

Wait, let me break it down step by step. First, identify each section: 2 (2,12) etc., then look at what's inside each bracket as a submatrix. Then figure out how these submatrices are placed within the bigger structure based on their dimensions and positions mentioned in parentheses like (2,12).

But honestly, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should focus on one part at a time. Let's take the first section: 2 (2,12) (1x1) 2 [[1]]. So maybe that's a single element matrix with value 2? Or is it a block of size 2x12 but only containing ones?

Wait, no, the numbers after the parentheses are probably not sizes. Maybe they're labels or identifiers for rows and columns in some way.

I'm not getting much here. I think I need to consider that each part might represent a submatrix at specific coordinates within the larger matrix. For example, 2 (8,17) could mean it's located starting at row 8, column 17 of something? But since all the main list entries are zeros, maybe these numbers define where certain blocks start.

This is getting too abstract for me. I think I'll try to sketch out a small part based on what I can understand and see if that helps.

Based on the provided information, it seems like the user has shared a structure involving multiple matrices with varying dimensions and elements set to specific values (like 1 or 4) while others are zeros. Here's an organized summary:

### Main Structure:
- **Large Matrix**: Composed of smaller submatrices arranged in different sections.

### Submatrix Details:
1. **First Section**:
   - Dimension: Not explicitly stated, but referenced as (2,12)
   - Value: 2
   - Content: [[1]]

2. **Second Section**:
   - Dimension: (3,4)
   - Value: 3
   - Content: [[1]]

3. **Third Section**:
   - Dimension: (11,5) as a 2x2 matrix
   - Value: 5
   - Content: [[1,1], [1,1]]

4. **Fourth Section**:
   - Dimension: (2,2)
   - Value: 1
   - Content: A 3x3 matrix with mostly zeros except for specific ones.

5. **Fifth Section**:
   - Dimension: (8,17) as a 3x3 matrix
   - Value: 4
   - Content: A 3x3 matrix filled with ones.

### Summary:
The overall structure is likely a composite matrix composed of smaller matrices at specific positions within it. Each submatrix has its own dimensions and elements, mostly zeros except for some sections marked with numbers (1s or 4s). Without more context, the exact layout isn't clear, but these components are assembled to form a larger matrix.
