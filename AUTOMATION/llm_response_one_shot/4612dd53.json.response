User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this test example input tree and a matrix. The task is to determine if the matrix represents a valid labeling of the tree according to some rules. But wait, what are these rules exactly? Since they aren't specified here, I'll need to infer based on the structure provided.

Looking at the first part: there's an initial setup with (0 (0, 0) (13x13) 0 [[...]]) followed by several elements inside. Each element seems to be a tuple or list containing different components. The last part is another tuple starting with (1 (2,7)...), which might indicate the root of the tree.

Each node in the tree has parameters: probably its position, some kind of value, and children nodes represented as matrices. For example, the first element after 0 is a matrix [[0s]], followed by elements like [3], [7], etc. Then there's a lot more structure with different numbers and brackets.

I'm thinking this might be related to graph labeling or tree traversal where each node has specific labels based on its position in a grid. Maybe it's about assigning coordinates (i,j) such that the sum i+j is unique for each label? Or perhaps following some numbering pattern across rows and columns.

Looking at the sample input: The initial part after 0 includes several matrices, like [[0s]] with size 13x13, then elements like [3], which might be a single value. Then moving on to more complex structures with multiple layers of brackets.

I should probably look for patterns in how these numbers are arranged and see if they fit into the structure of the tree. Maybe each number corresponds to a node's label, and its position in the matrix determines its (i,j) coordinates such that i + j gives a unique identifier or follows some sequence.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this is about the labels forming a binary space partitioning where each split alternates between x and y axes. So every time you go left or right, it affects one coordinate.

Alternatively, maybe it's similar to quadtree decomposition, where each node has four children corresponding to quadrants defined by their coordinates.

But in any case, without explicit rules, I need to figure out a possible method. Let me consider if there's some kind of breadth-first numbering going on or depth-first. The numbers seem increasing as we go deeper into the tree structure.

Perhaps each layer of the matrix corresponds to levels in the tree, and within each level, nodes are numbered sequentially. For example, root has number 1, then its children have higher numbers assigned based on their order.

Looking at specific examples: There's a node labeled (2,7) with value 3 [[1]], another (7,4) with 7, etc. Maybe the labels correspond to the depth in each dimension?

Alternatively, maybe it's about constructing a matrix where each cell corresponds to a label and its position dictates some property like being part of a subtree.

Wait, perhaps this is related to the Hilbert curve or Morton code (Z-order curve), which maps multi-dimensional data into one dimension while preserving locality. The idea is that each point in 2D space has coordinates (x,y) mapped as a single integer label based on interleaving bits of x and y.

But looking at the numbers, they don't seem to follow a straightforward interleaving pattern. For instance, 3 is followed by 7, then 8, etc., which might not correspond directly to binary bit interleaving.

Alternatively, could it be that each number represents a node in a grid where nodes are filled layer by layer? Like starting from the top-left corner and moving row-wise?

But without more specific information, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe this is checking if the labels follow a certain rule such as the sum of i + j being unique for each label.

Alternatively, perhaps it's testing if the tree is a valid binary space partitioning where each split reduces the area in both x and y directions. So every internal node would have two children: left (smaller x) and right (larger x), top (smaller y) and bottom (larger y).

Looking at some of the structures:

For example, one element is [[1, 1], [0, 1]]. This could represent a node where the lower-right quadrant has value 1.

Another matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 1]], which might be another split in x or y direction.

Wait, perhaps it's about binary flags indicating whether to split left/right or up/down. Each submatrix represents a child node.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the test example expects that each matrix corresponds to a specific type of partitioning until you reach leaf nodes (the single 0s). So if all non-leaf nodes are properly split, then it's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps every non-leaf node should have exactly two children, either in x or y direction. If any node doesn't follow this rule, the matrix is invalid.

But given that some matrices have more than two submatrices (like [[1, 1], [0,1]] which has four elements but not all are single values), maybe each leaf corresponds to a certain label.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's simpler: each number in the matrix must be present exactly once, and their positions determine some traversal order.

Alternatively, perhaps this is checking if each internal node properly partitions its space such that no overlapping occurs, ensuring all children are accounted for without gaps.

But since I don't have explicit rules, my best approach is to outline possible validation steps:

1. Check that the tree structure follows a consistent splitting rule (binary space partitioning).
2. Ensure every non-leaf node has exactly two children.
3. Verify that each leaf corresponds correctly based on its position in the grid.
4. Confirm that all labels are unique and fit within expected bounds.

Assuming these steps, I can then evaluate if the given matrix meets them or not.

But without knowing what's wrong with the test example, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe the test case is expecting a certain kind of structure, like a quadtree where each node has four children, but in this case, nodes only have two (left and right).

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the depth of the tree matching some property related to matrix dimensions.

Given that I can't be precise without more information, maybe I should outline how one would validate such a structure step by step.

To determine if the given matrix is a valid labeling of the provided tree structure, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Tree Structure**: The tree starts with an initial node (0) and follows with several levels of child nodes represented as matrices or numerical values.

2. **Identify Node Labels**: Each node within the tree should have a unique label corresponding to its position in the matrix.

3. **Validate Partitioning Rules**:
   - Ensure each internal node is properly partitioned into two children, maintaining consistency across all levels.
   - Check if every non-leaf node has exactly two children.

4. **Check for Completeness and Uniqueness**:
   - Verify that all labels are unique within the matrix.
   - Confirm there are no overlapping or missing nodes.

5. **Evaluate Positioning**:
   - Ensure each label corresponds correctly to its (i, j) position in the matrix, possibly following a specific ordering like breadth-first or depth-first traversal.

By systematically applying these checks, you can validate whether the provided matrix accurately represents a valid labeling of the tree structure according to the inferred rules.
