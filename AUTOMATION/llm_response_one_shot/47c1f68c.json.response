User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this data structure here that's represented as a list of lists. Let me try to understand what it is and how I can work with it. First off, looking at the input, it seems like there are multiple layers or maybe different matrices within the same array.

Starting from the top, I see a bunch of zeros arranged in rows and columns. It looks like each sublist represents a row in a matrix. The first part has eight rows, each containing ten zeros. Then, there's another set with 13 rows, each also having thirteen zeros. Following that, some more data comes in the form of [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]]. This seems like another matrix with five rows and four columns. Then there's an entry labeled (3 (0, 0) (13x13) 2 [[...]]) which is a bit confusing.

I think the main structure here is a list containing two matrices: one is 8x10 filled with zeros, another is 13x13 also filled with zeros. Then, there are these smaller matrices inside, maybe some transformation or specific subsets of data. The (3 (0, 0) (13x13) 2 [[...]]) part might indicate that at position (0,0), which could be the top-left corner, there's a 13x13 matrix and something else with value 3.

The second nested list has two sublists of ones. The first sublist is [0,0,0,...] with thirteen zeros except for some ones in specific positions, like at index 6 (counting from zero). Then another similar structure but with a one more towards the end. Finally, there's this big matrix filled entirely with ones.

I need to figure out what exactly I'm supposed to do with this data. Maybe visualize it or analyze its properties? If this is part of an algorithm or a problem, perhaps I need to count certain elements or find patterns.

Looking at the first 8x10 zero matrix, all entries are zeros except for maybe some hidden ones that aren't shown here. The next one is another 13x13 grid with mostly zeros but specific positions marked as one. Then there's a smaller matrix within it that seems to have a different pattern of ones and zeros.

The last part has two sublists, each starting with several zeros followed by a single one at position [6], then all zeros except for another one towards the end in the second sublist. This might represent connections or relationships between nodes in a graph or something similar.

I think to proceed, I should break down each matrix and analyze them individually. For each zero-filled matrix, maybe count how many non-zero elements they have if any are present. For the ones matrices, check their structure—maybe identify if there's a pattern like diagonal dominance or specific connectivity.

Additionally, considering the positions (0,0) mentioned in some of these submatrices could be significant for graph traversal or adjacency lists where each matrix represents connections from node 0 to others.

I'm also noticing that one of the matrices is entirely filled with ones except for maybe a couple of zeros. This might indicate a fully connected graph or something similar.

If I were to visualize this, it would help to see how these matrices relate to each other. Maybe the larger matrices are superimposing smaller grids on top of them, creating specific structures within the zero backgrounds.

Another thought is that perhaps these matrices represent different layers or stages in a process, where some parts remain unchanged (zeros) while others change based on certain rules (ones). This could be relevant for simulations or algorithms tracking state transitions.

I also wonder if there's any hierarchical structure here. The 13x13 matrix seems to contain smaller submatrices, which might imply nested systems or modules within a larger framework.

To sum up, my approach would be:

1. Identify each layer of the main array and analyze its properties.
2. Examine each submatrix for patterns or specific structures (zeros, ones).
3. Determine how these matrices relate to each other—perhaps overlapping regions or hierarchical nesting.
4. Consider potential applications like graph theory, simulation modeling, or data analysis based on the observed structure.

I need to clarify what exactly is required with this data so I can proceed effectively. Are there specific questions about connectivity, pattern recognition, or something else? Understanding the goal will help me process each part correctly.
</think>

The given data structure consists of multiple matrices, each represented as a nested list:

1. An 8x10 matrix filled with zeros.
2. A 13x13 matrix filled with mostly zeros and some ones in specific positions.

Additionally, there are smaller submatrices within these larger structures that contain patterns of ones and zeros. These smaller matrices might represent connections or relationships between nodes in a graph or other network-related structures.

To effectively analyze this data:

- **Visualize each matrix**: Observe the placement of ones (1) and zeros (0) to identify any patterns, such as diagonal dominance or specific connectivity.
- **Identify hierarchical structures**: Notice if smaller matrices are nested within larger ones, indicating a possible hierarchical or modular structure.
- **Consider applications**: Think about how this data could be used in algorithms for graph theory, simulations, or data analysis.

Understanding the goal of your analysis will guide you in processing and interpreting these matrices correctly.
