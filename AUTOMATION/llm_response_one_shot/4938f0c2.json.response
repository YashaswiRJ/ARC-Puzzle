User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, I'm looking at this problem here. It seems like it's about evaluating a tree structure where each node has some kind of value and maybe operations or something attached to them. The input is pretty detailed with numbers and arrays inside parentheses.

First off, the example starts with (0 [some array] 18x14) followed by another set of nodes connected with parentheses. Hmm, okay, so I think each main node has a number in brackets which might represent its value or perhaps some identifier. The next part seems to be specifying the size and the children it has.

I remember from algebra that sometimes operations are represented as trees where each operation branches out into its operands. Maybe this is similar? So, for instance, if I see something like (2 (a, b) (c x d) value), maybe 2 is an operation taking a and b with dimensions c and d to give some result.

Looking at the first part: (0 [0...0] 18x14). The array has sixteen zeros since it's size 18x14, but wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no—it says 18x14? That would be 252 elements, but the array inside is only fourteen zeros repeated multiple times. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, maybe each of those arrays is a separate element in the main array. Let me see: [0,...] with sixteen entries because it's size 18x14? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the numbers represent dimensions and the array inside has elements based on that.

Hold on, let me parse each part step by step.

The first node is (0). The next parts are:

(2 (0, 0) (18x14) 0 [[...]]) 

So this main node has a value of 0, with two children: one labeled 2, which connects to another structure. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe each main parenthesis contains the operation or something else. The first part is (0 [array] ...). So maybe it's an array where 0 is associated with some values? Not sure.

Wait, looking at the next line: 

(2 (0, 0) (18x14) 0 [[0,...], ...])

So that might mean a node labeled '2' which has two children: 0 and 0. Then this node is connected to an array of sixteen elements? Or something like dimensions.

This seems complex; perhaps I need to break it down more carefully.

Each main part in parentheses could be a function call with parameters, where the first parameter inside is the operation or label, then comes the children (arguments), and maybe some metadata about size or output?

Wait, looking at the test example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (18x14) 0 [[0,... multiple zeros...], ...]) 
Then another part: (2 (6,7) (3x3) 7 [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[0,0,1]])

So maybe each main node has:

- A label (first number)
- Its arguments or children (next numbers in parentheses)
- Size information like dimensions
- Some value (the last number before the array)
- Then an array that contains data based on those operations

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I should think of it as a tree where each node has parameters defining its type and some data.

For example, the first part: 0 [0...0] with size 18x14, value 0. Then connected to another node which is (2 (6,7) ... ) etc.

Alternatively, maybe this represents matrices or arrays being manipulated through operations like addition, multiplication, etc., where each operation takes certain dimensions and applies it across the array elements.

Looking at one of the sub-expressions:

(3 (6,6) (2x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1]])

So node labeled '3' with arguments (6,6), size (2x2), value 2, and an array [1,1;1,1]. Maybe this represents a matrix multiplication or some operation on two matrices of size 6x6 each? But then how does it relate to the larger structure?

Wait, perhaps each node is defining a computation step. For example:

The first big node: (0 ... )

It has arguments (0,0), and maybe some array operations.

Then another node which is labeled '2', with children 1 and 7? Hmm, but in the test input, I see multiple lines.

Wait, actually, looking at how it's structured, each main part is a separate node. The first line defines one node: (0 ...), then the second line another node: (2 ... ), etc.

So maybe these are separate nodes connected together? Or perhaps the entire structure is a single tree where the root has multiple children.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's time to look for similar structures or think about how such notations are used in computing or mathematics.

Alternatively, could this be representing an expression tree where each node performs an operation on its children? For example:

Each main node is a function with arguments and returns a value based on its operation.

Looking at the test input again:

First line: (0 ... )

Second line: (2 ... )

Third line: (3 ... )

Fourth line: (6 ... )

Fifth line: (7 ... )

So perhaps each of these represents separate operations, each taking their own set of arguments and returning some value. The numbers in the parentheses could be operation codes or something.

Then after that, an array follows which contains numerical data—possibly inputs to these operations.

This is getting somewhere. So maybe it's like this: For each node (operation), we have its parameters, then connect them with arrays of numbers. But how does it all tie together?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure represents a series of matrix multiplications or tensor operations where each sub-operation defines dimensions and elements which are then used in subsequent operations.

Wait, I recall that in some programming languages like Haskell or ML, you can represent data structures as trees with nodes containing different types of information. Maybe this is similar?

Alternatively, if we think about tensors in machine learning frameworks, they often have shapes (like 18x14) and elements. Operations on tensors would require knowing their dimensions to perform element-wise operations.

So perhaps each node defines a tensor operation where:

- The first number is the label or type of operation.
- The next numbers are the dimensions of the tensors involved.
- The following number is the value, maybe a scalar output.
- Then an array follows which represents the actual data for that tensor.

But how do these nodes connect? Each main node seems to be standalone with its own set of arguments and outputs. Unless they form a chain where the output of one feeds into another.

Wait, perhaps each node is part of a computation graph where inputs are passed through operations to produce an output. The arrays would represent input vectors or matrices for these operations.

But in that case, I need more context on how the nodes connect and what operations they perform based on their numbers.

Alternatively, maybe this notation is from category theory, with each node representing a morphism (operation) with specified domain and codomain dimensions.

Wait, category theory uses objects and arrows between them. If we consider each number as an object (like a vector space of certain dimension), then the operations could be functors or morphisms that take these spaces to others.

But I'm not sure if this applies here since the notation isn't standard for me.

Alternatively, thinking about linear algebra, maybe each node is a matrix multiplication operation where:

- The label defines what kind of matrix (maybe transpose, multiply, etc.)
- The arguments are the dimensions
- The value is some scalar or another parameter like a learning rate
- Then an array provides the actual elements

But without knowing exactly how these nodes combine, it's hard to compute.

Wait, maybe each line represents a separate operation, and all of them together form a computation graph. But then what do we output? Maybe evaluating from left to right or top to bottom?

Alternatively, perhaps this is representing a sequence of matrix multiplications where the dimensions must match for multiplication to occur. For example:

(0 ...) with 18x14 might be a vector of size 18*14.

Then (2 ... ) maybe transposes it? Or reshapes it? Not sure.

The next part is (3 (6,6) (2x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1]]) which could mean applying a matrix operation to a 6x6 matrix using another 2x2 matrix scaled by 2, resulting in some new array.

But I'm not getting the whole picture. Perhaps it's better to think step-by-step on each node and see if any patterns emerge.

Starting with the first line:

(0 [array of sixteen zeros] (18x14) value=0)

Wait, maybe this is a vector or matrix multiplication where 0 represents an identity element? Or perhaps zero as in no operation. Not sure.

Second line: 

(2 (6,7) (3x3) 7 [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[0,0,1]])

This might be another operation with arguments 6 and 7, dimensions 3x3, value=7, array=[ [1,1,1], [0,0,1], [0,0,1] ]

Third line:

(3 (something) ... )

Wait, maybe each main node has parameters: an operation code, a list of inputs, size info, a scalar output, and then an array.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in between parentheses are indices or positions for elements. But without knowing how they combine, it's difficult to tell.

Given that all these nodes have arrays following them with 0s and 1s, maybe those represent binary masks or selection matrices?

Wait, in matrix operations, sometimes you use masking to select certain parts of a matrix. For example, multiplying by a mask matrix which has ones where elements are selected and zeros elsewhere.

So perhaps each operation is taking some input array (from previous nodes) and applying it with a mask, then scaling or adding something based on the value.

But I'm still unclear without more context on how these operations interrelate.

Alternatively, maybe this notation represents a graph where each node processes data from its inputs and passes to outputs. For example:

Each operation takes input arrays, processes them (maybe element-wise), and produces an output array which is then used by subsequent nodes.

In that case, the entire structure would be evaluated bottom-up or top-down based on dependencies.

But again, without knowing how these are connected in a graph, it's challenging to compute the result.

Wait, maybe since each line starts with an operation code (0,2,3,6,7), and followed by arguments, size info, value, and array. Perhaps this is like a pipeline where each operation uses the output of previous operations? But then what input do they need?

Alternatively, perhaps all these are standalone computations that don't depend on each other.

Wait, but without knowing their dependencies, it's impossible to evaluate them in order.

Alternatively, maybe they're part of a single computation sequence. Starting with (0 ... ), then moving to (2 ... ) etc., feeding the output into the next operation.

But again, no idea about how the operations are defined or what they do.

Wait, perhaps each node is an input layer that defines a vector/matrix and propagates it through operations.

But without knowing the exact sequence of operations required, I can't compute anything.

Alternatively, maybe this is representing a state machine where each operation changes the state based on some rules. But again, too vague.

Given all these uncertainties, perhaps my best approach is to look for patterns in the numbers and arrays provided.

Looking at the first line:

Operation: 0
Input dimensions: [18x14]
Output value: 0
Array: sixteen zeros (probably a vector or matrix)

Second line:

Operation:2
Inputs:6,7
Dimensions:3x3
Value:7
Array:
[1,1,1;
0,0,1;
0,0,1]

Third line not provided.

Looking at the arrays given in operations 0 and 2. The first array is all zeros; maybe that's a bias vector? Or perhaps an initial state?

The second operation has an array with three rows: [1,1,1], then two rows of [0,0,1]. This looks like a mask or selector matrix.

Alternatively, this could be a transformation matrix where the first row selects all elements and sums them (sum equals 3), while the other rows select specific elements. Maybe it's used for some kind of weighted sum?

Wait, if we have an array with sixteen zeros from operation 0, and then in operation 2, the array is a 3x3 matrix:

First row:1,1,1

Second row:0,0,1

Third row:0,0,1

So when you multiply this mask (matrix) by the 18x14 vector (array of sixteen zeros?), it's unclear how that would work. Dimensions don't match.

Alternatively, maybe operation 2 is a matrix multiplication where:

Operation inputs are numbers 6 and 7,

Dimensions:3x3

Value:7,

Array: [ [1,1,1], [0,0,1], [0,0,1] ]

Wait, if the array has three rows each with three elements, perhaps it's a 3x3 matrix. But what is operation code 2 doing? Maybe adding something.

But without knowing the exact operations for codes 0 and 2, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe this represents an expression tree where:

Each node evaluates its children first, then applies some function based on its type (operation code).

For example:

Code 0: Evaluate previous nodes, sum them? Or multiply?

But without knowing the operation definitions, I can't compute anything.

Wait a minute. Maybe each line is independent and defines a tensor or vector with specific properties, but all operations are separate, so their results don't depend on others unless specified.

Given that, perhaps evaluating each node separately:

For example, starting with (0 ...) which has an array of sixteen zeros—maybe this represents a zero vector/matrix.

Then (2 ...) uses the 3x3 mask and some inputs. But since we only have numbers 6 and7 as arguments before size info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe all these operations are linked in a computation graph where each node feeds into another.

But without knowing how they connect, I can't compute anything.

Wait, but the user initially asked for an evaluation of this structure. If the entire thing is treated as input to some function, perhaps the output would be 0? Or maybe based on mask operations.

Alternatively, since all arrays are zeros except in operation 2 which has a few ones, perhaps it's masking and adding something that results in zero again.

But honestly, without more context or information about what these codes represent (like matrix multiplication, addition, etc.), I can't perform the computation. Maybe this is part of an algorithm where each code corresponds to a specific operation step.

Given that all these operations have value 0 or7, and arrays with mostly zeros except for certain ones, perhaps the final result would be zero because everything gets masked out.

But honestly, without knowing what exactly each operation does, it's impossible to evaluate accurately. Perhaps if I assume some default behaviors:

- Operation code 0: Maybe a constant zero vector/matrix.
- Operation code2: Applying a mask which sums elements but with some scaling.

But since the array is all zeros, applying any sum or filter would still result in zero unless there are non-zero inputs.

Alternatively, maybe operation code6 and7 have arrays that when combined with previous operations produce a final output. But without knowing how they interact, it's impossible to say.

I think I need more information about what each code represents (i.e., the actual operations: add, multiply, transpose, etc.) based on their codes 0-9 or whatever system is being used here.

Alternatively, maybe this is a typo and these should be part of a specific function call, but without knowing which function they belong to, it's hard to proceed.

Given all that, perhaps the best I can do is acknowledge the ambiguity in the problem statement. Without further context on what each code represents or how the operations are structured (like input dependencies), evaluating this isn't possible accurately.
</think>

It seems there's a lot of ambiguity in the provided structure. Each line starts with an operation code followed by arguments, size information, a value, and an array. However, without knowing what these codes represent or how they interact, it's impossible to evaluate them accurately.

If you could provide more context on what each code represents (like matrix operations) or clarify how the arrays are used in conjunction with previous results, I'd be able to assist better.
