User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert an input tree into an output tree based on some transformation rules. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Looking at the examples provided:

**Train Example 1:**
- Input Tree:
  - Root is a node with children (4 nodes) each connected by edges of size (2,3), and then their own subtrees.
- Output Tree:
  - The root now has 6 connections instead of 4. It seems like the number of child edges increases from 4 to 6.

Hmm, so maybe when we're processing a node, if it's an input tree node, we expand its children based on some pattern or rule that increases the count? But in the output, each original child is replaced with multiple copies?

Wait, looking closer:
- Input: (0 (0,0) ... 4 [[...]] )
- Output: 6 instead of 4. So perhaps the number of edges increases by a certain factor.

Similarly, in Train Example 2:
- Root had 3 children in input and became 6 in output.
Wait no, actually looking at the structure:

Wait the first example's root is labeled with [[...]] which I think represents its children. In the input, each node has a list of children nodes, right?

So for instance, in Train Example 1:
- The root (0) had four children: three from the first part and one after.
In the output, it expanded to six.

Wait no, actually looking at the notation:

It seems like each tuple is structured as node info. For example, (0 (0,0)(3x4) 0 ... ), where I think (0,0) are the number of inputs/outputs or something, and then the children.

But perhaps focusing on how many children each node has after transformation:

In input:
- The root in Example 1 had two main branches: one with 2 nodes and another with 3. Wait no, maybe it's more about how many edges are connected to the node?

Wait I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, looking at how the connections (edges) between layers change:

For example, in Train Example 1:
- The root has a child that was originally size 2x3 and now becomes 6x4. So perhaps when we process nodes, each original edge is expanded to multiple edges?

Wait the node's children are being replaced with a matrix of connections.

Alternatively, looking at how each node in the input tree is transformed into a block of nodes in the output:

For instance:
In the first example, the 9 (5,0)(1x3) became [[1,1]], which suggests that perhaps for each original child, we create multiple children based on some rule.

But I'm not entirely clear. Maybe it's better to see how the numbers change and find a pattern.

Looking at Test Example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (3x4) 0 [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]] 
(4 (0,0) (3x4) 1 [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,1],[1,1,0,0]] 
(9 (0,2) (1x2) 2 [[1,1]] 
(9 (2,2) (1x2) 3 [[1,1]]) ))

So the root has two main branches: one with edge count (0,0) and another.

In output:
The first part is same as input up to a point. Then it's replaced by:

Looking at Output Tree for Test Example, perhaps each original child in the test case leads to multiple children based on some matrix operations or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe when processing a node labeled with certain numbers (like 9), we create a block of nodes as per another rule.

But without knowing exactly what transformation rules are supposed to be applied, it's hard for me to reverse engineer. Maybe I need to think about the possible transformations based on examples.

In Training Example 1:

Input Root has children that start with 4 edges (0 (0,0) ...). The output root now has 6 connections instead of 4. So perhaps each original edge is being split into multiple edges in some fashion.

Wait looking at the children:
- In input: after root's first child was a node labeled 3x4? Wait not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of inputs/outputs or dimensions changing based on certain operations like matrix multiplication. For instance, in neural networks, layers have input and output sizes.

If I consider each tuple as (node_id, in_size, out_size, ...), then perhaps when processing a node, its children are transformed into multiple nodes whose connections are determined by some operation involving the parent's edges.

Alternatively, think about it as each original connection being replaced with multiple new ones. For example, an edge of size m x n could be split into k x l edges after transformation.

Looking at Train Example 1:

Original root: (0 (0,0)(2,3) ...). Wait maybe the first number is in_size and second is out_size? So for node 0, it has children connected by edges of size 2x3. In output, this became 6 instead of 4.

Wait perhaps when processing a node with k children, each original edge is expanded into multiple new edges based on another parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the first example's root had two main branches: one leading to four nodes and another single node, making total five? Or not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe looking for some pattern in how the numbers change:

In Training Example 1:
- Input root's children are [[4], [3]], then output becomes 6.
But maybe 2 + 3 =5, but it became 6, so perhaps adding one more?

Similarly, another example: Input had two branches with 4 and 4 edges; Output became 8.

Wait in Train Example 1's input:
- The main root node has a child which is (0) connected by edge size (2,3). Then that node (0)'s children are four nodes. So total edges from the root to its first child would be multiplied?

Hmm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each original edge is being expanded based on some function of its size.

Wait looking at Train Example 1:

Original: Each connection was size (2,3). Then in output, it became a connection size of 6x4. So 2*3=6 and 3+ something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of connections is being increased by multiplying certain factors based on other parameters like node IDs or layers.

But honestly, without knowing exactly what transformation rules are supposed to be applied, it's hard for me to reverse-engineer this. Maybe I need more information about how these transformations work, such as whether they involve matrix multiplication, replication of nodes, or some kind of expansion based on layer sizes.

Given the time constraints and my current understanding, perhaps the best approach is to assume that each original edge (or node) is being expanded into multiple edges in a way that increases their count. For example, if an input has n edges, output might have more than n by replicating or expanding them based on some rule.

In the test case, since the root had connections leading to 9 and then another 9, perhaps each of those is being expanded into two nodes in the output, hence doubling from 2 to 4?

But I'm just speculating here. Maybe focusing on how the number of edges increases: from (3x4) in input to (6x4) in output.

Alternatively, thinking that for each original edge between layers i and j with size m x n, it's being transformed into a block matrix where each element is replaced by another set of connections. For example, if the transformation involves duplicating edges multiple times based on some pattern.

But again, without knowing exactly what transformations are intended, I can't be precise.

Perhaps focusing on how the output tree's structure changes:

In all examples, when processing a node labeled with certain numbers (like 9), it seems to be generating a matrix of child nodes. For instance, in Test Example, label 2 is connected to [[1,1]], meaning one child node; but wait no, actually looking at the output, perhaps each number corresponds to multiple children.

Alternatively, maybe when a node has an ID (like 9) followed by two numbers inside brackets, it's indicating that this node will have as many children nodes as there are elements in that bracket. For example, [[1,2]] would mean two child nodes.

Looking at the first example:

Original: 9 (0,2)(1x3) → so node 9 has three child nodes? But no, looking at output, it's replaced by some structure with more connections.

But I'm not sure. Maybe each number after the label represents a new layer's connections.

Wait perhaps in the input tree:

Each tuple is structured as (node_id, source_edges, destination_edges, children). So for example, node 0 has source edges of size (0,0) connected to nodes with certain properties.

But this is getting too vague.

I think I need a different approach. Let's consider that each node in the input tree corresponds to some transformation rule in the output. For instance, when processing a node labeled 'n', it might generate multiple child nodes based on another number or structure.

For example:
- If a node has label 9 followed by (0,2)(1x3), maybe it's indicating that this node will have three children connected with edges of size 1x3. In the output, perhaps these connections are expanded into multiple new edges.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of matrices:

If an edge from layer i to j is m x n, then processing might involve transforming each element into a k x l matrix, effectively expanding it into more edges. For example, if each 1x3 edge becomes two edges with size something like 2x3 or similar.

But without knowing the exact transformation function, I can't be certain.

Perhaps looking at how the number of nodes increases:

In Training Example 1:
- Input had a root connected to some nodes (total five), output has more connections but same number of nodes? Or different?

Alternatively, perhaps each original node is being duplicated based on its label or position in the tree.

Wait another idea: Maybe when you have a tuple like n followed by two numbers inside brackets, it represents that this node will generate multiple child nodes equal to the first number and their edges are determined by the second number. For example:

In Test Example:
- 2 (0) → probably no children
- 9 (0,2)(1x3) → maybe three child nodes with edge size 1x3

But in the output tree's structure, it seems like node 9 has more than three children.

Alternatively, perhaps each number after a tuple represents how many new edges are created from that node. So for example:

In Test Example:
- Node labeled '2' connects to one child (since there's only [1])
- Node labeled '9' with two numbers might connect to multiple children based on those numbers.

But I'm not getting anywhere concrete here.

I think, given my limited understanding of the specific transformations intended, the best I can do is outline a general approach:

1. Parse both input and output trees.
2. For each node in the input tree, determine how its structure maps to nodes in the output tree.
3. Identify patterns or transformation rules based on similarities between input and output structures.
4. Apply these rules to construct the output tree from a given input.

But since I can't see any clear pattern here, maybe it's better to assume that each node's properties are being transformed in some way related to their labels or edges.

For instance:
- The number of children might be multiplied by some factor based on another parameter.
- Edge sizes might be altered through addition or multiplication.
- Node IDs could remain the same or change based on their position.

But again, without more data points, it's hard to formulate exact rules.

In conclusion, I'm unable to accurately determine how to map from the input tree to the output tree due to insufficient information about the transformation rules. If there were examples showing corresponding nodes and their transformed versions, that would help a lot. But as it stands, I can only provide speculative ideas based on educated guesses.
</think>

To solve the problem of mapping an input tree to an output tree using unknown transformations, we need to deduce the transformation rules based on given examples. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Analyze Input and Output Structures:**
   - Examine both the input and output trees to identify patterns in node connections, edge sizes, and child nodes.
   
2. **Identify Transformation Rules:**
   - Look for similarities between corresponding parts of the input and output trees to infer how each part transforms.
   - For example:
     - Node IDs might remain the same or change based on their position.
     - Edge sizes could be scaled or altered in specific ways (e.g., multiplied by a factor).
     - Child nodes may increase or decrease in number based on certain parameters.

3. **Apply Identified Rules to Construct Output:**
   - Use the deduced transformation rules to convert each part of the input tree into its corresponding output representation.
   
4. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Ensure that the transformations are consistent across all parts of the trees to maintain structural integrity in the output.

By following these steps, we can systematically apply the unknown transformations to generate an accurate output tree from a given input tree.
