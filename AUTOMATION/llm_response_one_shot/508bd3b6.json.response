User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this input tree here that I need to test. It's a bit complex with all these numbers and nested structures. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the initial structure: (0 (0, 0) (12x12) 0 [[...]]) This seems like a node with two children, both labeled 0. The size is 12x12, which probably means the matrix or grid it's operating on is 12 rows by 12 columns. Then there are some transformations applied: an identity matrix (since all the values in the first sub-array are zeros except for ones on the diagonal), followed by something with eight 0s and three 9s, which might be selecting certain elements or applying specific operations.

Next, I see another branch starting with (8 (0, 3) (2x2) 1 [[1, 0], [0, 1]]). This is another node with two children: one labeled 0 and the other 3. The size here is 2x2, and there's an identity matrix applied again.

Then there's a branch labeled (2 (0, 8) (12x4) 2 [[...]]) which has two children: 0 and 8. The size is 12 rows by 4 columns. This part seems to have more transformations, probably combining elements from the parent nodes based on some criteria.

I think the key here is understanding how these layers interact. Each node processes its data, possibly modifying it through operations like matrix multiplication or element selection, and then passes it down to child nodes. The numbers in parentheses might represent dimensions, and the arrays inside could be transformation matrices or masks.

I'm a bit confused about what exactly each number signifies—like (0, 3) or (8, 9). Maybe they represent indices or offsets? I need to figure out how these values are used in the transformations. The sub-branches with numbers like [[1, 0], [0, 1]] likely represent identity matrices that select specific elements.

Wait, there's also something about dimensions changing from 12x12 down to smaller sizes like 8 and then 2x2. Maybe this is a multi-layered structure where each layer reduces the dimensionality in some way, possibly for feature extraction or data compression.

I should probably start by mapping out how the transformations affect each part of the matrix. For example, the initial identity matrix might just pass through the original values, while the selection matrices pick specific rows or columns to combine into new structures.

Also, the presence of multiple layers suggests that this could be a type of neural network architecture, where data flows through different nodes and gets transformed at each layer. Maybe it's used for classification tasks where features are extracted in stages.

I'm not entirely sure about all the operations here, but breaking it down into smaller parts might help. Each node seems to handle its own set of transformations independently before passing the results to their children. The final structure would be a combination of these processed values from both branches.

In summary, I need to parse each node's parameters: the size (like 12x12), the operations applied (identity matrices and selection masks), and how they combine with other nodes' outputs. Then, simulate this process step by step to see what the final result would be.
</think>

The input tree represents a hierarchical structure of operations on matrices, likely used in machine learning for feature extraction or data transformation. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Root Node**:
   - Size: 12x12
   - Operations: Identity matrix (keeps original values), selection masks (pick specific elements)
   - Children: Two nodes labeled 0 and 0

2. **First Child Branch**:
   - Size: 8x3
   - Operation: Identity matrix, selecting specific indices
   - Children: Two nodes labeled 9,6

3. **Second Child Branch**:
   - Size: 12x4
   - Operations: Multiple selection masks (combine elements)
   - Children: Two nodes labeled 0 and 8

Each node processes its data through transformations like identity matrices and selection masks before passing the results to child nodes, creating a multi-layered structure for feature extraction.
