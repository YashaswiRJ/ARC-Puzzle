User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this tree output was generated from the input example. Let me start by looking at both examples provided.

First, in the Input Tree, there's a structure with multiple components. Each component has a type (like (8 (3,2) ...)), and then some values inside brackets that seem to represent matrices or arrays. The Output tree is similar but different. My goal is to understand how each part of the input translates into the output.

Looking at the first example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (13x13) 0 [[0,0,...], ... etc.] 
Then some sub-components like (8 (5,10) ...), and so on.

Output tree is similar but with different numbers. For instance, the main component in Output has type (2 (0,0)...). So each input's component seems to transform into an output component based on some rules.

Maybe it's a transformation of the initial 0s into other values. I notice that in the first example, the input starts with several zeros and then some numbers like 8, 5, etc., while the Output has different numbers like 2,1,7,2,3,4,5.

Perhaps each number is being transformed based on its position or something else. Maybe it's a matter of applying some operations to these components, maybe addition or multiplication?

Wait, looking at the first sub-component in Input: (8 (3,2) ...), and in Output, that same part becomes 0... Hmm, not sure.

Another approach is to see how each initial number maps to another. For example, starting from the top:

Input main type seems to be something like a node with value 13x13 matrix of zeros, then sub-components.

In the Output tree, it's (2 (0,0)...). Maybe the initial zero is being transformed into some structure based on operations defined elsewhere.

Also, I see that in Input, there are components like [[1]] or [[1,1]], and in Output they're converted to different matrices. So perhaps these are transformation rules applied per sub-component.

Maybe each number inside the brackets represents a weight or an operation count? Or maybe it's about some matrix operations like addition, subtraction?

Alternatively, could this be related to graph theory? Maybe nodes transforming into other structures based on edges or something similar.

Wait, looking at the numbers: in Input components, we have values like 5,10; 1,5;4,9 etc., and in Output they become different. Maybe it's about applying a formula where output number = input number minus some value? Or maybe it's based on the indices or positions.

Another thought is that each sub-component's numbers are being transformed into another set of numbers via matrix operations. For example, [[1]] could be a single operation resulting in 3, and [[1,1]] results in 4. Maybe these are weights assigned to certain operations?

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to break down the first Input-Output pair step by step.

Looking at the main structure:

Input: (0 (0,0) (13x13) ... )

Output: (2 (0,0)... )

So perhaps 13 becomes 2? Or maybe each component is being processed individually and then combined.

Another idea: Maybe these are transformations based on some formula. For example, the first number in a sub-component might be divided by something or used as an index.

Wait, looking at Input:

(8 (5,10) ...), Output becomes 2?

Hmm, maybe 5+10=15? But that doesn't get me to 2.

Alternatively, 5*10=50, but still not matching.

Or perhaps it's modulo: 15 mod something. Maybe 8 is the key here because in Input first sub-component is (8 (3,2)...), and Output starts with (2...). So maybe subtracting from 10? 10-8=2?

Wait that could be a possibility.

So if I think each main number is being transformed as follows: output = input - something. For example:

Input has 8, and Output becomes 2.

Similarly, Input has (5,10), which might become the Output's numbers... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the count of non-zero elements? Let me see: in Input first sub-component is [[1]], so one non-zero. In Output, that same position had a 3x3 matrix with mostly ones except some zeros. Not matching.

Wait another angle: Maybe each number is being replaced by its value modulo something. For example:

8 mod 6 = 2

5 mod 4=1

But not sure how it applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first component's numbers are combined in a certain way to produce Output.

Let me consider this: In Input, starting from the top, we have (0 (0,0)...). Then inside that, there is (8 (3,2) ...). Maybe 3 and 2 are being transformed into something else. Like 3+2=5, but in Output it's not directly clear.

Wait, maybe these numbers represent nodes or edges, and each operation reduces them based on some rule. But without knowing the exact transformation rules, it's hard to be precise.

Perhaps I should look at all components:

In Input, main type is 13x13 zeros with certain sub-components: (8 (3,2)...), then another sub-component (5 (4,9) ...). And in Output, these seem to have been transformed into other numbers. Maybe each number inside the brackets is being replaced based on some mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps this represents a kind of state transition where each initial value transitions through several steps to reach the output values. But without knowing the exact process, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe looking at how many sub-components are there in Input and Output could help. Input has multiple components with different numbers inside brackets; same for Output but with transformed numbers. Maybe these transformations follow a pattern based on their positions or values.

Another thought: Could this be related to binary operations? For instance, the initial zeros might represent something that is being toggled by these sub-components which are providing 1s and other numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps each number represents an instruction pointer or something similar in a program structure. Maybe each transformation is executing a different operation based on those numbers.

Wait, maybe it's more about matrix transformations where the initial zeros are getting replaced by non-zero values through some operations defined by these sub-components with their own numbers.

But this seems too vague without knowing the exact rules of transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps each number in brackets corresponds to the number of nodes or edges added in a graph structure. So if you have 1s and multiple components, it's building up into something else. But again, not sure.

Wait, let me think about how the Output tree is constructed from Input:

Input has (0 ...), which becomes (2 ...). Maybe 0 transformed to 2 based on some operation. Then each sub-component in Input gets transformed as well. For example:

In Input: (8 (3,2) ...) becomes something that results in a new value for the Output.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how many non-zero elements are present. In Input main component, you have 13x13=169 zeros and then some ones. Maybe these numbers define how the output is built up.

But honestly, I'm not getting anywhere without more information on what exactly the transformation rules are. Each sub-component's transformation isn't clear to me unless there's a defined formula or pattern that maps each number in Input to Output.

Alternatively, maybe it's about some kind of cipher where numbers are being shifted by certain values. For example:

In the first main component: 0 becomes 2; perhaps 0 + 2 =2.

Then (8...): Maybe 8-6=2?

But then other components don't fit this pattern.

Alternatively, maybe it's about binary representations or hexadecimal conversions. But again, not sure.

I think without more context on the specific transformation rules being applied, I can only hypothesize based on limited information. Perhaps someone with more expertise in tree transformations or matrix operations could provide a better explanation.
</think>

The Output Tree is generated by transforming each component of the Input Tree according to specific rules that map input values to output values. Each sub-component within the Input Tree undergoes a transformation, resulting in changes to the numbers and matrices represented in the Output Tree. The exact nature of these transformations is not fully clear without additional context or defined rules, but they appear to involve converting initial zero matrices and numerical values into new configurations based on some underlying algorithm or formula.

Final Answer:
The Output Tree results from applying specific transformation rules to each component of the Input Tree, altering numbers and matrix structures accordingly.
