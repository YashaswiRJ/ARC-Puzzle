User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this test example here that involves some kind of tree structure. It looks like a nested list with various dimensions and numbers attached to different parts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the input starts with (0 (0, 0) (5x5) 0 ...). I'm assuming this is describing a node in a tree where 0 might be an identifier or some value associated with that node. The numbers following are probably dimensions or counts related to the structure of the tree.

Then there's [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]. This is a 5x5 matrix filled with zeros. Maybe this represents some kind of grid or adjacency matrix for the tree.

Next, there's (7 (0, 0) (2x2) 1 [[1, 1], [1, 1]] ...). So another node labeled 7, which is a part of a 2x2 structure. It has one child with value 1 and a similar matrix filled with ones.

Following that, there's (3 (0, 0) (3x3) 2 [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]] ...). Another node labeled 3 with three children. The first two have zeros and the last has ones.

Then another part: (2 (0, 0) (5x5) 3 [[0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]] ...). So node 2 with five dimensions and three children.

Putting it all together, I think this represents some kind of hierarchical or tree-like data structure where each node can have multiple children. The numbers in the brackets might denote how many children each node has at different levels, but it's a bit confusing because sometimes they repeat numbers like (5x5), which could mean dimensions rather than counts.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact interpretation without more context, but I think breaking down each part and seeing how the matrices are structured is key here. Maybe each matrix corresponds to connections or weights between nodes at different levels of the tree.

Another thing I notice is that there are multiple layers with increasing numbers like 5x5, then 2x2, 3x3, etc. Perhaps this represents a multi-level structure where each level has its own grid size for connections or data storage.

I should probably start by visualizing how these matrices and node counts relate to the overall tree structure. It seems complex with several layers of nesting, so carefully mapping out each component might help in understanding it better.

Also, noticing that some nodes have children with ones indicates maybe a binary presence (like active vs inactive) or some kind of filter applied at different levels.

I think I'll need to create a diagram or something similar to map out the hierarchy and connections between these nodes based on their dimensions and values. This might help in analyzing how data flows through the tree or how different parts interact with each other.

In summary, while I'm still not entirely clear on the exact meaning of all these numbers and matrices, breaking down each nested part step by step and looking for patterns should give me a clearer picture of what this test example represents.
</think>

The test example provided is a complex tree structure represented as a nested list with various dimensions and values. Each node in the tree appears to have specific attributes such as identifiers, dimensions, counts, and matrices associated with it. Below is a breakdown of the structure:

1. **Root Node**: 
   - Identifier: 0
   - Dimensions: 5x5
   - Value: 0

This structure suggests a hierarchical data model where each node has its own set of connections and values, possibly used in machine learning applications like neural networks or graph-based computations.

**Final Answer:**

The test example represents a complex tree structure with nodes having specific identifiers, dimensions, counts, and associated matrices. Each node appears to be part of a multi-level hierarchy, with nested matrices indicating potential connections or data storage at different levels. The exact interpretation depends on the context in which this structure is used, but it provides a framework for hierarchical data processing.
