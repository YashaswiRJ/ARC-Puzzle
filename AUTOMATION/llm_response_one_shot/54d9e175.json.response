User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this input tree structure here, and I need to figure out what it represents. It looks like some kind of nested list with numbers and sublists. Let me break it down step by step.

First, there's a main node labeled (0 (0, 0) (7x11) ...). The part in parentheses after the number is probably its identifier or something. Then there are multiple children nodes connected to this parent. Each child has a label and some kind of matrix associated with it.

Looking closer, I see that each node seems to have three parts: the first number inside the parenthesis might be the node's index, followed by two numbers in parentheses, probably representing coordinates or something related to its position. The third part is another set of parentheses containing more details about the node, which includes a matrix and other child nodes.

The matrices are all 7x11 in size for some nodes and smaller ones like 3x3 or 1x1 for others. Each element in these matrices is mostly zeros except for a few ones scattered around. It seems like each matrix might represent connections or links between different parts of the tree structure.

I also notice that there are numbers attached to parentheses, like (2 (1, 1) (1x1) 2 [[1]]), which probably indicates some kind of weight or value associated with that node. These weights seem to be concentrated in certain areas of the matrix where there are ones.

Looking at the test example provided, it's similar but has different matrices and connections. It seems like each node is connected based on its coordinates (like (1,5) for one connection), and these connections influence how data flows or interacts within the tree.

I'm trying to figure out what this structure could represent. Maybe it's a graph where nodes are connected in specific ways, using matrices as adjacency matrices? The 7x11 matrices might indicate that each node is part of a larger grid, while smaller ones like 3x3 could be sub-sections or something.

The ones in the matrix probably denote edges or connections between nodes at those positions. So if there's a 1 at (i,j), it means there's an edge from row i to column j. The labels attached might be identifiers for each node, helping to map out how they connect within the larger structure.

I'm also noticing that some parts have coordinates like (0,0) or (4,8). These could represent positions in a two-dimensional space where nodes are placed. The connections between these points would then define the edges of the tree.

The 5 [[1]] part probably means there's another node with label 5 connected to it at that position. This recursive structure suggests that each node can have multiple children, creating a complex network of connections.

In the test example, there are numbers like (2 (1, 1) (1x1) 2 [[1]]) which again indicates a weight or value associated with that specific connection. These weights might be used in some kind of algorithm to calculate paths or interactions within the tree.

Overall, it looks like this is a way to represent a graph where each node has specific coordinates and connections defined by matrices. The structure allows for complex relationships between nodes, using sub-matrices for more detailed sections. Each connection's weight influences how information or data flows through the network.

I think I need to parse this input tree recursively, breaking it down into its components: parent nodes with their own children, each connected via these matrix-based links. The matrices likely play a crucial role in determining connectivity and the strength of those connections based on their positions.

To understand this better, maybe I should start by identifying all the top-level nodes, then look at their children recursively. Each child would have its own set of coordinates and sub-matrices, so it's like diving deeper into each branch until all leaves are accounted for.

It might help to draw a diagram or represent this structure visually as a tree with nodes connected based on these matrices. This visual aid could make the relationships clearer and easier to understand.

I should also consider what practical applications this kind of structure might have. Maybe in network routing, data flow optimization, or some form of spatial data organization where proximity plays a role.

In any case, by methodically breaking down each part of the input tree—starting from the root node, examining its children, and recursively doing so for each child—I can piece together what this entire structure represents. Each matrix acts as a filter or connection map that dictates how nodes interact with each other at various levels of the hierarchy.

I think I've got a basic grasp now. The next step is to try implementing some kind of parser or interpreter for this structure, translating it into something more usable like an adjacency list or graph representation. That way, I can leverage existing graph algorithms to analyze and utilize this tree effectively.
</think>

The input represents a hierarchical tree structure where each node is defined by its identifier, coordinates, and associated matrix connections. The matrices likely define the connectivity between nodes at specific positions within their respective grids.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Main Node**: The root node is labeled with identifier 0, positioned at (0, 0), connected to other nodes via a 7x11 matrix. This suggests it is part of a larger grid structure where each element in the matrix represents potential connections.

2. **Connections and Matrices**:
   - Each child node has its own position coordinates and an associated matrix.
   - The matrices are sparse, with mostly zero values except for specific positions marked by ones, indicating direct connections between nodes at those coordinates.

3. **Sub-Nodes and Weights**:
   - Nodes like 5 [[1]] indicate additional sub-nodes connected via weights or strengths represented by the numbers in parentheses.
   - The recursive structure allows for complex networks with multiple layers of connectivity.

4. **Practical Applications**:
   - This structure could be used to model spatial networks, routing systems, or graph-based algorithms where connections and their strengths are critical.

To visualize this, you can represent it as a tree where each node branches out based on its matrix connections, forming a complex network that can be analyzed for connectivity patterns or optimized for specific tasks.
