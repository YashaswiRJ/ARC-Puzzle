User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Okay, let me try to figure out what this problem is asking. I see a lot of numbers and brackets here. It looks like it's a sequence of operations or something structured with different groupings and counts in parentheses. 

First, at the top, there are multiple lines starting with "4 (...)", which probably means some operation repeated four times. Then each line has another part within the parentheses that might be defining parameters for that operation. For example, (1x1) might indicate a 1x1 matrix or something similar. Then I see numbers like 20, 24, 25 following these, which could be identifiers or results of those operations.

As I go down, there are lines with different groupings—some in single digits and some in double digits, like (9, 15) or (6, 21). Then towards the end, there's a big number 8 followed by (4, 2) and another huge matrix defined inside. That seems complex.

I think this might be related to matrices or algebraic operations where you define dimensions and specific structures. The numbers could represent dimensions of vectors or matrices, and the groupings in parentheses might indicate how they are being combined or multiplied. For example, (1x1) probably refers to a 1 by 1 matrix which is just a single number.

The last line mentions an 8 followed by (4,2), and then a huge matrix with specific patterns. Maybe this is part of a larger system where you're defining the structure of these matrices or perhaps setting up equations that lead to some result based on these dimensions.

I'm not entirely sure how all these parts connect, but it seems like each line defines a component or step in building up to something more complex, possibly solving for unknowns or constructing a specific matrix configuration. It might be helpful if I try to parse the structure step by step, looking at each operation's parameters and seeing how they fit into a bigger picture.

Maybe starting with the first few lines:

4 (15,25) (1x1) 20
This could mean an operation done four times with dimensions 15 and 25 resulting in something related to 20. Then another line:
4 (16,9) (1x1) 24

Similarly, each subsequent line defines a new component or step, incrementing some numbers while others change based on the current operation's result.

Looking at the latter part, towards the end, there are more complex groupings like (3x2), (4x2), and even an 8 with (4,2). The final section is a huge matrix with specific patterns in its entries. It might be that each of these components contributes to building up this large matrix.

I think my main takeaway here is that it's constructing a system where different operations or matrices are defined step by step, and the final part is the culmination of all those steps into one comprehensive structure—a big matrix with specific patterns based on previous calculations. I need to break down each component and see how they interrelate.

I should probably go through each line methodically, noting down the parameters and what follows them. Maybe creating a table or list would help me track which parts correspond to which operations or matrices. Once I have all components outlined, I can look for patterns or rules that dictate how one part leads to another, eventually building up to understanding how this final matrix is constructed.

It's also possible that some of these numbers are indices in the matrix, like row and column positions, while others represent dimensions or specific properties within those matrices. Without knowing the exact context or purpose of each number, it's challenging to map them all correctly, but trying to find logical connections between them might clarify things.

In summary, my approach is:
1. List out each component with its parameters.
2. Identify potential relationships or rules connecting these components.
3. Look for patterns in numbers and how they increment or change based on the operations.
4. Try to piece together how all parts contribute to constructing the final matrix structure.

This might take some time, but methodically breaking it down should help me understand what's going on here.

The problem involves a complex series of algebraic structures, likely matrices or vectors, defined through multiple steps with specific dimensions and properties. Each line defines an operation repeated four times (indicated by the "4 (...)" notation), followed by parameters that specify how it's applied, often resulting in a 1x1 matrix for simplicity.

Key components include:
- Dimensions like 15x25, 16x9, etc., which likely represent vector or matrix dimensions.
- Groupings such as (1x1) indicating single-element matrices or specific operations within each step.
- Final lines defining larger structures with detailed patterns, including matrices of sizes up to 8x4.

The overall goal appears to be constructing a comprehensive matrix structure by systematically applying these operations and grouping them based on defined parameters. Each line contributes a piece to the final puzzle, culminating in a large, structured matrix as described in the last section.

In summary, each component builds upon the previous steps, contributing parts of a larger matrix with specific patterns determined by preceding calculations. The process involves methodically defining each part and understanding how they interrelate to form the final structure.
