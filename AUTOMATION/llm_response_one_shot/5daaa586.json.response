User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem here that involves a bunch of matrices and some operations on them. Honestly, at first glance, it looks pretty intimidating with all these numbers and symbols scattered around. But let me try to break it down step by step.

First off, I see there's a list starting with [0, 0, 0, ...] multiple times. There are seven of those lists, each containing sixteen zeros. So that's like a big matrix filled with zeros. Maybe this is some kind of initial state or something?

Then, after that, there are several operations listed in parentheses. Each operation seems to be in the format (number (parameters) (matrix dimensions) (result)). For example, the first one is (1 (0, 5) (1x1) 2 [[1]]). Hmm, okay. So maybe each of these represents a transformation or some kind of matrix update.

Let me take the first operation: (1 (0,5) (1x1) 2 [[1]]). I'm not entirely sure what this means, but perhaps it's indicating that at position (0,5), we're placing a 1 in a new matrix of size 1x1. And maybe the result is stored as 2? I don't know.

Moving on to the next one: (1 (0,9) (1x1) 3 [[1]]). Similar structure here but at position (0,9), value 3 with a 1x1 matrix filled with 1. Hmm, maybe these are updating some grid or array?

Then there's (1 (1,7) (1x1) 5 [[1]]). So this is placing a 5 at position (1,7). I'm guessing the numbers inside the tuples might be coordinates in a matrix.

Continuing like that: (3 (2,13) (1x2) 8 [[1,1]]), which would place an 8 at (2,13) with a 1x2 matrix filled with [1,1]. Wait, is the first number before the parenthesis indicating something else? Maybe it's like a step or level.

This is getting confusing. Let me try to list out all these operations:

1. (1 (0,5) (1x1) 2 [[1]])
2. (1 (0,9) (1x1) 3 [[1]])
3. (1 (1,7) (1x1) 5 [[1]])
4. (1 (3,0) (1x1) 9 [[1]])
5. (1 (4,5) (1x1) 10 [[1]])
6. (1 (4,10) (1x1) 11 [[1]])
7. (1 (5,0) (1x1) 12 [[1]])
8. (1 (6,8) (1x1) 13 [[1]])
9. (1 (6,14) (1x1) 14 [[1]])
10. (1 (9,1) (1x1) 16 [[1]])
11. (1 (10,7) (1x1) 17 [[1]])
12. (1 (11,1) (1x1) 18 [[1]])
13. (3 (2,13) (1x2) 8 [[1,1]])
14. (3 (2,0) (1x3) 6 [[1,1,1]])
15. (1 (7,9) (2x2) 15 [[0,1], [1,0]])
16. (3 (2,4) (1x8) 7 [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]])
17. (2 (0,12) (13x1) 4 [[1],[1],[1],...,[1]] with 13 ones)
18. (8 (13,0) (1x15) 19 [[1,1,...,1]] with 15 ones
19. (1 (15,6) (1x1) 22 [[1]])
20. (2 (14,12) (2x1) 21 [[1],[1]])
21. (1 (14,3) (2x2) 20 [[1,1], [1,0]])
22. (1 (0,3) (13x3) 1 [[1,0,0],...,[1,0,0]])

Wow, that's a lot. Maybe these are all operations on some kind of grid or matrix where each operation is writing a value to a specific position with certain dimensions.

Looking at the last few operations:

22. (1 (0,3) (13x3) 1 [[1,0,0],...,[1,0,0]])

This seems like placing a vector of three ones starting from row 0, column 3 in a matrix with 13 rows and 3 columns.

But I'm not sure how all these operations relate to each other or what the final result is supposed to be. Maybe it's some kind of iterative process building up this grid step by step?

Also, seeing numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc., before some brackets—maybe those are indices into an array? Or perhaps they're indicating some operation counts.

Wait, looking at the first few operations:

1. (1 (0,5) (1x1) 2 [[1]])
Maybe this is setting a value of 1 at position (0,5), and then scaling it by 2?

Or perhaps these numbers are like step numbers in an algorithm? Maybe each operation builds on the previous one.

This is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to find some pattern or figure out what these operations represent.

Looking back at the initial matrix of zeros: [0,0,...] multiple times. Maybe this is a grid where we're placing values from these operations into specific cells, and eventually, we have to sum them up or something.

Wait, operation 15 is (2 (0,12) (13x1) 4 [[1],[1],...,[1]]). So that's writing four ones starting at position (0,12), but the matrix is 13 rows by 1 column. So positions go from (0,12), (1,12), ..., up to (12,12).

But in operation 16: (8 (13,0) (1x15) 19 [[1,...]]). Hmm, maybe this is another row with 15 columns.

Wait, perhaps it's a grid that grows both in rows and columns as we perform these operations. But I'm getting lost here.

Another approach: Maybe each operation corresponds to setting certain elements of a matrix based on some rule or algorithm, like gradient descent or something else? But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe this is related to convolutional neural networks where these operations are kernels being applied at specific positions. The numbers might represent weights in the kernel. For example, (1 (0,5) (1x1) 2 [[1]]) could be a kernel with value 2 at position (0,5). But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking again: Each operation starts with a number, then parameters inside parentheses, and ends with something in brackets. Maybe the first number is an identifier for the operation? Like Operation 1, Operation 2, etc.

But without knowing what these operations are supposed to do or what the final goal is, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps this is part of a larger problem that's not provided here. Maybe I need more information about what these matrices represent and how they're being updated.

Wait, maybe if I look at all these numbers before each operation:

First set: 1 appears multiple times as the first number in several operations.

Then some have 3, then 2, 8, etc. It's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matrix with certain properties being modified through these operations. For example, setting specific elements and then computing something like a determinant or trace at the end.

But without knowing what to compute, I can't say for sure.

Wait, looking back: The last operation is (1 (0,3) (13x3) 1 [[1,0,0],...,[1,0,0]]). So that's writing a vector of ones into the first three columns. Maybe in the end, we're supposed to sum all these vectors?

Alternatively, maybe it's constructing a basis matrix or something similar.

This is getting too abstract. I think without more context about what exactly needs to be done with these operations, it's challenging to figure out the intended outcome. Perhaps someone else can shed light on this if they know the origin of the problem.
</think>

The problem presented involves several operations on matrices that modify specific positions within them. Each operation updates a value at a given coordinate and may involve setting or scaling values based on provided dimensions and resulting matrix content. However, without knowing the exact goal or context of these operations (e.g., whether it's for solving a system of equations, performing convolution, etc.), it's difficult to provide a precise interpretation or final result.

To summarize, each operation appears to be placing specific values into a matrix at designated coordinates and scaling them according to some rule. The sequence of these operations likely builds up the final state of the matrix step by step. However, without further information about the intended outcome or additional context surrounding these operations, it's challenging to determine their exact purpose or compute the final result.

If you have more details or specific instructions related to these operations, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis or solution.
