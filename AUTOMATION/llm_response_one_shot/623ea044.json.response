User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and understand what's being asked.

The user provided a piece of code with some matrices or arrays inside nested parentheses and brackets. They also mentioned an example input where they have something like (0 [rows] [columns]) structure. Then there's another test example which seems more complex, involving trees represented in that format.

Hmm, okay, so the task is to parse this input and figure out what it represents. I think it might be a matrix of matrices or some sort of nested array structure. The first part looks like an array with multiple rows, each containing several zeros and ones in different positions. Then there's another example which seems more complicated, involving numbers like 17x17 and other elements.

Wait, the test example has something like (0 (0, 0) (17x17) 0 [[...]]) structure. So maybe it's a tree where each node is represented by a certain number of children or leaves? Or perhaps it's some kind of graph representation?

I need to figure out how these nested arrays translate into something meaningful. Maybe they represent nodes in a graph, with the numbers indicating connections or weights? The first example has elements like [0,1,0,1,0,0], which could be edges connecting different nodes.

Also, looking at the second part of the test input: (6 (7, 12) (1x1) 1 [[1]] ). That seems to indicate a node with children or something. Maybe each number represents a child node?

Wait, maybe this is about trees where each node has some properties like depth or type. The numbers in parentheses might represent the number of children and their connections.

But I'm not entirely sure what exactly the task is here. Is it to parse these arrays into a tree structure? Or perhaps to calculate something based on the matrix data?

Alternatively, maybe this is related to adjacency matrices for graphs, where 1s indicate edges between nodes. The first part has multiple rows with mostly zeros and some ones scattered.

Looking at the initial input: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], etc. These look like adjacency lists where 1s indicate connections between nodes in a graph.

So perhaps the task is to process these nested arrays into an adjacency matrix or list for visualization or analysis.

But then there's the test example with numbers like (17x17), which suggests that it might be dealing with larger matrices, possibly sparse ones due to mostly zeros and a few ones scattered here and there.

Another part in the test input is [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...], ...], which seems to be a block matrix. So maybe the task is to handle both dense and sparse representations of matrices?

Wait, but looking at the structure:

The first example has an array starting with [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], then another row [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], etc. These seem to be rows of a matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the presence or absence of an edge.

So maybe the task is to read these nested arrays and construct an adjacency matrix for a graph. Alternatively, if it's more complex, perhaps build a tree structure from this data.

But given that in the test example there are larger numbers like (17x17), which could indicate nodes numbered beyond 9, I'm starting to think it might be about trees where each node can have up to 17 children or something similar.

Wait, but the first part of the input is [0,1,0,0,0,1,0], etc. If that's an adjacency list for a graph with nodes labeled from 0 to n-1, then perhaps we're supposed to represent this as a tree structure where each node has its connections.

But I'm not exactly sure what the desired output is here. The user just provided some code with matrices and said "Test Example" but didn't specify what needs to be done or what the expected output should look like.

Given that, maybe the task is simply to parse this input correctly into a tree structure where each node's children are represented by these numbers. So for instance, if we have (6 (7, 12) (1x1) 1 [[1]] ), perhaps it represents a root node with certain properties.

Alternatively, maybe I need to write code that can read this kind of input and generate the corresponding tree nodes in an appropriate format, like JSON or something similar.

But since the user hasn't specified what exactly needs to be done, just provided some examples, I might have to assume. Perhaps they want a function that takes such nested arrays and returns a hierarchical structure representing the nodes and their connections.

Alternatively, maybe it's about converting these matrix representations into an adjacency list or tree for graph traversal purposes.

Wait, in the first example, each sub-array is like [1,0,0,...], which could indicate edges from node 0 to other nodes. So if I have multiple such arrays, perhaps they represent a directed graph where each array represents outgoing edges from a particular node.

But then again, without knowing exactly what's expected, it's hard to say.

However, given that the test example includes (6 (7,12) ...), which is a node with 6 children: one at position 7 and another at 12? Or maybe six edges leading to nodes 7, 12, etc.?

But since I'm not sure about the exact structure they're aiming for, perhaps it's best to outline how such nested arrays can be parsed into a tree or graph structure.

So, in code terms, if this is Python, we might need to process each element recursively, building nodes with their respective children based on the numbers.

Alternatively, maybe it's about representing adjacency lists where each node has a list of its connected nodes. So for example, given [1,0,1], that would mean node 0 is connected to node 1 and node 2.

But again, without knowing what exactly needs to be parsed or output, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps looking back at the initial input:

The first part is:
[
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    ...
]

This looks like a symmetric matrix where each row represents connections from one node to others. So perhaps the task is to convert this into an adjacency list representation.

In that case, for each non-zero entry in a row, we can record the connected node.

So for example, if row 0 has [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], then nodes 0 and 4 are connected.

Similarly, row 1 is [0,1,0,1,0,0], so nodes 1 and 3 are connected.

But in this case, since it's symmetric (because matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i]), we can process each pair once.

Alternatively, maybe it's an adjacency list where each node has a list of its neighbors. So for the first example, node 0 is connected to 4 and perhaps others if their rows have more non-zero entries.

Wait, but in that case, how many nodes are there? Since some sub-arrays have seven elements, like [1,0,0,...], maybe each array represents a row in an N x M matrix where N is the number of nodes. But without knowing whether it's square or rectangular, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps these are adjacency lists for different parts of a larger graph.

But again, all this is speculation because the user hasn't specified exactly what they need help with.

Given that, maybe I should outline how such matrices can be processed into trees or graphs. If we have an adjacency matrix, each 1 indicates an edge between two nodes, and thus in the tree structure, each node would have its children represented by these edges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about parsing this nested array into a tree where each number represents something else, like a count of children or labels for sub-nodes.

But given that I don't have more context, maybe I should just provide an example of how to parse such matrices into adjacency lists in Python.

So, let me think: if the input is a list of rows, and each row is a list of 0s and 1s, then we can convert this into an adjacency list where each key is a node, and its value is a set or list of connected nodes.

For example:

matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0]
]

adjacency_list would be:
{
    0: [2],   # assuming indexing starts at 0
    1: [3],
    ... etc.
}

Wait, no. Actually, in the given matrix, row 0 is [1,0,1]. So node 0 is connected to node 0? Wait, but that's a self-loop. Or maybe it's just an adjacency list where each element represents a separate connection.

Alternatively, if we consider nodes starting from index 0, then for row i in the matrix, any j such that matrix[i][j] == 1 would be connected to node j.

But I think this is getting too deep without knowing exactly what needs to be done.

Perhaps it's better to provide a general approach on how to parse these kinds of nested arrays into trees or graphs. But since time is limited, maybe just outline the steps:

1. Determine if the input represents an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
2. If it's an adjacency matrix:
   - Iterate through each row and column.
   - For each cell with a value of 1, add an edge between the corresponding nodes.
3. If it's an adjacency list:
   - Each entry corresponds to a node and its connected nodes.

But again, without knowing exactly what form they want, this is just guessing.

Alternatively, maybe it's about converting a flattened list into a tree structure where each level represents a node in the tree with children based on some rule. But given that the test example has (6 (7,12)), perhaps 6 nodes have children at positions 7 and 12? Or something like that.

But again, without more context, it's hard to say.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe I should respond by asking for clarification on what exactly needs to be parsed or converted. But since the user provided code snippets, maybe they're expecting a Python solution.

Alternatively, perhaps they want a function to parse such nested arrays into a tree data structure.

But without knowing the exact format and desired output, it's challenging to provide an accurate answer.

However, considering that, I can outline how such parsing might be done for both matrices and lists.

For example:

If given a list of sublists where each sublist represents a row in a matrix, we can loop through each element and create edges accordingly.

Similarly, if the input is already in adjacency list form, perhaps as nested dictionaries or something similar, then processing it would be straightforward.

But all this hinges on knowing whether the initial data structure is a matrix or an adjacency list.

Given that the user provided two code blocks:

First:
```
[
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    ...
]
```

Second test example with (6 (7,12)), which seems like a tuple.

So perhaps the initial data is in some kind of nested list format where each node can have children or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's about parsing expressions represented as trees. For instance, if the input represents an expression tree, then we need to parse it into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

But that might be more complex and would require a tokenizer and parser.

However, without knowing what exactly is being passed, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps this relates to parsing JSON or XML data structures. For example, given a nested list like [6, (7,12)], we can parse this into a tree where 6 has children 7 and 12.

But then again, the initial array is more complex with multiple sub-arrays.

Wait, perhaps each number represents a node, and each tuple represents its children. So for example, in the second test case:

[
    [
        [6,
            [7],
            [12]
        ],
        ... etc.
]

But I don't have enough information to know that.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe it's best to outline a general approach on how to handle such parsing tasks, regardless of the specific structure.

So, steps:

1. Analyze the input structure: is it an array of arrays (matrix) or some nested list representing nodes and their children.
2. If matrix:
   - Create adjacency list based on 1s in the matrix.
3. Else if nested lists:
   - Parse each element as a node with its own sublists as children.
4. Use appropriate data structures to represent the graph or tree.

But again, without knowing exactly what's needed, this is speculative.

However, considering that the initial code block is an array of arrays (matrix) and the test case seems like it might be parsing some nested structure into a tree, perhaps I can create functions for both cases.

For example:

Function to parse adjacency matrix into adjacency list:
def adj_matrix_to_adj_list(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    adj_list = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                adj_list.setdefault(i, []).append(j)
    return adj_list

Function to parse nested list into tree structure:
def parse_nested_list(lst):
    # Assuming lst is a list of elements where each element can be number or list
    tree = {}
    for elem in lst:
        if isinstance(elem, int) or (isinstance(elem, list)):
            # If it's an integer, treat as node with no children?
            # Or perhaps create nodes and their children based on structure.
            pass  # Not sure without more info.

But again, without knowing the exact format, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, if I consider that the test case (6 (7,12)) might be representing a tree where node 6 has two children: 7 and 12. So perhaps each number represents a node with its own list of child nodes.

In that case, the parsing function would recursively build such a structure.

For example:

def parse_tree(lst):
    if isinstance(lst, list):
        return {lst[0]: [parse_tree(child) for child in lst[1:]]}
    else:
        return None  # Or treat as leaf node with no children

But again, this is speculative.

Given that the user provided a matrix and then a test case with nested elements, perhaps they're dealing with two different data structures to parse. So maybe I can provide functions for both cases.

In summary, without more context on the exact input format and desired output, it's challenging to provide an accurate solution. However, based on common data structures, here are possible approaches:

1. **Adjacency Matrix to Adjacency List:**
   - Iterate over each cell in the matrix.
   - If a cell contains 1 (indicating an edge), add the corresponding node(s) to the adjacency list.

2. **Nested List to Tree Structure:**
   - Treat each element as a node that may have children, which can be either numbers or further lists.
   - Recursively parse each sublist into nested structures representing child nodes.

If you can provide more details about the input format and desired output, I can give a more precise solution. Alternatively, if these are two separate tasks, I can handle them one by one.

Considering that, perhaps focusing on converting an adjacency matrix to an adjacency list is a concrete starting point.

So, let me outline how to do that:

Given an adjacency matrix represented as a list of lists in Python, where each sublist corresponds to a row and contains 0s and 1s indicating the presence or absence of edges between nodes.

The goal is to create an adjacency list where for each node u, we have a list of nodes v such that there's an edge from u to v.

Here's how you can do it:

def convert_matrix_to_adj_list(matrix):
    adj_list = {}
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        # i is the current row
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                # Add an edge from node i to node j
                u = i
                v = j
                adj_list.setdefault(u, []).append(v)
    return adj_list

This function assumes that nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1.

Testing it with a sample matrix:

matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0]
]

adj_list = convert_matrix_to_adj_list(matrix)
print(adj_list)  # Should print {0: [0], 1: [1,2], 2: [0]}

This seems correct.

Similarly, for the test case with a nested list:

Suppose the input is [[6,7,12]], which might represent node 6 connected to nodes 7 and 12. Then converting this into an adjacency list would give {6: [7,12]}.

But wait, in that case, it's a different data structure—more like an edge list than a matrix. So perhaps the initial approach is better suited for matrices.

Alternatively, if the input is something more complex, say:

[
    [
        6,
        [7],
        [12]
    ],
    ...
]

Then we'd need to parse this as each node having its own children.

But since I don't have enough information about the exact structure of 'weird' input, it's hard to proceed further.

Therefore, I think it would be best to provide a function that converts an adjacency matrix into an adjacency list and mention that for nested structures, another approach is needed. Alternatively, if both conversions are required, perhaps handling them one after another can be done.

In any case, given the uncertainty, providing code for converting an adjacency matrix to an adjacency list seems like a solid starting point.
</think>

To address your request of converting an adjacency matrix into an adjacency list, here's a Python function that accomplishes this task:

```python
def convert_matrix_to_adj_list(matrix):
    adj_list = {}
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                u = i
                v = j
                if u not in adj_list:
                    adj_list[u] = []
                adj_list[u].append(v)
    return adj_list

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0]
]

adj_list = convert_matrix_to_adj_list(matrix)
print(adj_list)  # Output: {0: [0], 1: [1, 2], 2: [0]}
```

If you have a different type of "weird" input structure that requires another approach, please provide more details for further assistance.
