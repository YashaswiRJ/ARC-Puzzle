User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this input tree here that someone called a "test example." It looks pretty complicated with all these numbers and parentheses. I'm not exactly sure what each part means yet, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the structure seems like a lot of nested tuples. Each tuple has elements separated by commas inside parentheses. The first element after the opening parenthesis is usually another set of parentheses or sometimes an operator. It looks like these are defining some kind of tree with nodes that have attributes and child nodes.

Let me start from the top:

1. The entire expression starts with `(0 (0, 0) (21x12) ...)`. So there's a node labeled `0` which has two children: another node `0` and something else that might be an array or a list because it ends with parentheses.

   - Inside the first tuple after `0`, there are two elements: `0` and `0`.
   - Then `(21x12)` seems to describe some kind of structure, maybe dimensions? 21 by 12.
   - Following that is another part in parentheses with `[... ] (8 ...) ...`. I'm not entirely sure what the numbers before each parenthesis represent.

Maybe these are parameters for creating nodes or defining their properties. The `x` could mean multiplication, so perhaps it's a dimensionality thing like width and height?

Moving down:

2. Next is `(8 (5, 4) (1x1) 3 [[1]] )`. So this node has an identifier `8`, two children: one labeled `5` with maybe some attributes, another labeled `4`, then something else.

   - Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe the first number is a tag and the rest are parameters?

Wait, perhaps each tuple represents a node where the first element is the node's value or label, followed by its children in parentheses, and then some attributes.

Looking back at the initial structure:

- The main tree starts with `(0 (0, 0) ... )`. So it's a node labeled `0` with two children: another `0` and an array of size 21x12. Then that node has more children like `(8 ...)`, which is probably its next child.

It seems complex. Maybe this represents some kind of graph structure where each node can have multiple attributes, such as labels, dimensions, and connected nodes with certain weights or connections.

Another part I see:

- `(2 (14, 11) (6x1) 4 [[1], [1], [1], [1]] ))`. So this is a node labeled `2` with two children: one labeled `14`, another labeled `11`, and then an array of size 6x1.

I'm not sure if these labels are unique or have some significance. The numbers in the parentheses might represent connections to other nodes, maybe like edges with weights?

Also, inside arrays like `[0, 0, ...]` with multiple zeros could indicate something like binary states or absence of connections.

Wait, looking at the `[[1]]` and `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`, these look like matrices. The first is a single element matrix, maybe representing a self-loop? The second is a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal and off-diagonal.

So perhaps each node can have connections represented by these matrices. Maybe the numbers before them are weights or something else?

This is getting more complicated than I thought. Maybe this structure represents a graph where nodes are connected based on these adjacency matrices, which could be part of some kind of graph neural network or similar.

But without knowing exactly what each part means, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the labels in parentheses before numbers represent node IDs and their attributes?

Looking at another example:

- `(2 (14, 11) (6x1) 4 [[1], [1], [1], [1]] ))`: So this is a node labeled `2` with children `14` and `11`, an array of size 6x1, and four connections. The connections are represented by `[1], [1], etc.` which might be weights or something.

Wait, the numbers before each parenthesis: For example, `(8 (5, 4) (1x1) 3 [[1]] )` starts with `8`, then `(5,4)` is the first child, then `(1x1)`, then a number `3`, and an array. Maybe this indicates that node `8` has three children: nodes `5`, `4`, each possibly connected in some way.

Similarly, another part:

- `(2 (1, 0) (6x1) 1 [[1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1]] ))`: So node labeled `2` with two children: nodes `1` and `0`, array size 6x1, and one connection. The connections are all `[1]`.

This could mean that node `2` is connected to another node (maybe itself?) or other nodes via edges with weight 1.

Given the complexity, I think each tuple defines a node with attributes: label, children, number of connections, and adjacency matrix properties for those connections.

But since this is so complex and I'm not familiar with the exact notation used here, it's challenging to construct an accurate graph representation or algorithm. Maybe if I try to visualize it step by step.

Starting from the top:

1. Node `0` has two children: node `0` (maybe itself) and an array of size 21x12.
   - This array could be another layer in a neural network, perhaps?
   - The number before `(8 ... )` is maybe indicating connections or something else.

But without knowing the exact rules or definitions for each part, it's difficult. Maybe I should look up similar notations to figure out what this represents.

Alternatively, if this is representing a graph with nodes and edges where numbers indicate node IDs, labels are in parentheses before numbers? Or maybe tags?

Wait, perhaps each tuple starts with a label, then the children follow, followed by attributes like weight or something else.

For example:

- `(0 (0, 0) (21x12) ... )`: Node `0` has two children labeled `0`, and an array of size 21x12. Then it's connected to another node with label `8`.

But I'm not sure what the `...` includes. Maybe a list of child nodes or their properties.

This is getting too confusing without knowing the exact rules. Maybe I should approach this by looking at specific parts and trying to guess based on common graph structures.

Looking at `(5, 4)`: If these are node IDs, maybe they are connected via some edge? And the array size `1x1` could be an adjacency matrix indicating a single connection or self-loop.

The number before it is `3`, which might indicate three edges connecting nodes `5` and `4`.

Then inside `[... ] (8 ...) ...`: Maybe this is a list of edges, where each entry has parameters like weight, type, etc.

Wait, if I see something like `(8 (5, 4) (1x1) 3 [[1]] )`, maybe it's node `8` connected to nodes `5` and `4` with three edges? The `[1]` could be the weights of those connections. So perhaps there are three edges between `5` and `4`, each with weight 1.

Similarly, `(2 (14, 11) (6x1) 4 [[1], [1], etc.] )`: Node `2` connected to nodes `14` and `11` via four edges. Each connection has a list `[1]` which might represent weight or something else.

But again, without knowing the exact meaning of these numbers and symbols, it's hard to proceed.

Maybe I should consider that each node is defined by its label, its children, and some adjacency matrices for connections between nodes. The number before `(8 ...)` could be a tag or identifier.

Perhaps this structure represents something like an adjacency list where each node has multiple connections with weights represented by the arrays.

Given all these uncertainties, I think my best approach is to try to write down what each part might represent based on common graph notations and see if that makes sense.

Let me attempt to outline a possible representation:

- Each tuple represents a node.
- The first element after the opening parenthesis is the node's label or identifier.
- Inside parentheses, separated by commas, are child nodes (sub-tuples) and possibly other attributes like weights or connections.

But it's unclear whether each number in the main tuple corresponds to children or something else. Maybe the numbers before each inner parenthesis are connection counts?

Alternatively, maybe this is a graph where nodes have multiple edges defined with different parameters, such as weights, types, etc., represented by the arrays and numbers inside.

Given that I'm stuck on understanding exactly what each part represents, perhaps it's best to look up similar notations or think about how such structures are typically used in machine learning contexts, like graph neural networks where nodes have attributes and edges represent connections with certain weights.

If this is a layer of a graph neural network, the numbers could represent node features, edge connections, etc. For example:

- Node `0` has two children (maybe input nodes) connected via an array that defines some feature vector or connection pattern.
- Other nodes like `8`, `2`, etc., have their own connections and weights defined by the arrays.

But without knowing the exact rules for parsing these tuples, it's challenging to reconstruct the graph accurately.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider each tuple as defining an operation on the previous layer, where numbers correspond to node counts or connection parameters. For example:

- `(0 (0, 0) (21x12))` could be the input layer with two nodes connected via a 21x12 matrix.
- Other layers like `8`, `5`, etc., define hidden layers with their own connections based on these matrices.

But again, this is speculative without clear definitions.

Given my limited understanding of the notation and context, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on common graph structures. However, it's possible that my interpretation will be incorrect due to lack of knowledge about this specific notation system.

In summary, constructing a meaningful graph from this structure requires understanding what each part represents—labels, children, connections, weights, etc.—which isn't clear without additional context or definition of the notation used.
</think>

To construct an accurate graph representation based on the provided structure, we need to understand the specific notation and rules used. Since the exact meaning of each element (numbers, labels, arrays) is unclear without additional context, constructing a precise graph is challenging.

However, based on common graph notations and potential interpretations:

1. **Node Representation**:
   - Each tuple represents a node.
   - The first element after the opening parenthesis could be the node's identifier or label.
   - Child nodes are represented by subsequent tuples within parentheses.

2. **Connections and Weights**:
   - Numbers before inner parentheses might indicate connection counts or weights between nodes.
   - Arrays (e.g., `1x1`, `6x1`) could represent adjacency matrices defining connections between nodes, with elements indicating weights or presence of edges.

3. **Graph Structure**:
   - The input layer could consist of two nodes connected via a 21x12 matrix.
   - Subsequent layers (e.g., node `8`) might define hidden layers with their own connection patterns based on defined matrices.

In conclusion, without explicit definitions of the notation used, constructing an exact graph is speculative. However, a potential representation could involve multiple nodes and layers with connections defined by the arrays and numbers within each tuple, resembling a neural network structure where nodes have attributes and edges represent weighted connections.
