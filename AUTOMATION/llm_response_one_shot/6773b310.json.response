User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this input tree structure that's pretty complicated. It looks like it's built using some kind of nested parentheses and arrays. The user probably wants me to parse this structure or maybe evaluate something about it based on the examples they provided.

First, let me try to understand the structure. Starting from the top, there's a main node with two children: one labeled (0 ... ) and another (11x11). Then each of those has more nodes attached to them. It seems like this is some kind of tree where each node can have multiple children.

Looking at the test example, when I input a certain structure, it's supposed to output something related to an array with 0s and 1s. The user provided an example where there was a sub-structure [[0, 0, 0, 1, ...], [another row]] and the output included these arrays as well.

I think what the user is asking for is that they want me to process this tree structure and maybe extract certain parts of it or compute something based on it. They might be expecting an output array with specific indices filled with 0s and 1s, similar to how in some programming problems you traverse a grid or a binary matrix.

Wait, the user also mentioned that there's a sub-test example where they have these arrays filled with 0s and 1s, like [[0,0,...], ...] being part of larger structures. So perhaps each node has children which are either numbers (like 6) followed by coordinates or another structure in parentheses.

Given the complexity, I need to figure out a way to represent this tree in code so that I can process it step by step. Maybe using recursion would help because trees are naturally recursive structures. Each node can be processed by handling its children first and then doing something with their results.

I should probably start by writing a function that takes a string input, parses it into an abstract syntax tree or some kind of nested list structure, and then recursively processes each node according to specific rules. But before I jump into coding, maybe I can outline the steps:

1. Parse the input string into a structured format like nested lists.
2. Traverse this structure recursively.
3. For nodes with number and coordinates (like (number coord)), do something based on those values.
4. For other structures, process their children accordingly.

Wait, in the test example, when there was an 8 child node labeled (0,0), it had a sub-structure that resulted in two rows of [1s and 0s]. So maybe each time I encounter a structure like [[...]], it represents some kind of grid or array that needs to be constructed.

I think the key is to map each part of the tree to building these arrays. For example, when there's a node with (6, something), perhaps we need to append an array based on its coordinates and the sub-structures attached to it.

But I'm not entirely sure how exactly to translate this into code without more examples. Maybe the user can provide some sample input and desired output so that I can test my approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the way these arrays are generated from their parent nodes. For instance, each time an 8 or another number is followed by coordinates, it triggers the creation of a new array based on its children structures.

I should also consider how to handle nested parentheses and commas since that affects how the tree is structured. Perhaps using a stack-based approach would help in parsing the string correctly.

Another thing I need to figure out is what each node represents. Are they coordinates, dimensions, or some operation? In the test example, it seems like nodes with numbers followed by coordinates are positions in an array. The sub-structures might define how those arrays should be filled.

Maybe each node (except the root) corresponds to a position in an output grid where certain bits (0s and 1s) need to be placed based on their path from the root. So, for example, if you have a coordinate like (0,8), that might correspond to row 6 or something?

Wait, looking back at the test example:

The main node has two children: one is labeled 0 with an array of arrays, and the other is labeled 11x11. The output includes various sub-arrays filled with 0s and 1s. So perhaps each node corresponds to a specific position in the final grid.

I think I need to map the coordinates from each node to indices in the resulting array. For instance, (0,8) might correspond to row 6 or another index depending on how the tree is structured.

Another approach: Maybe the numbers before the coordinate pairs are layer depths or something that determine which part of the grid they influence. So processing nodes at certain depths would affect specific parts of the output array.

This seems a bit vague, though. Without more examples or clear mapping rules, it's hard to proceed accurately. I might need to make some assumptions about how each node contributes to the final array structure.

Perhaps if I consider that each coordinate pair (like 0,8) represents an index in the grid, and each number before them is a depth level determining which sub-array or part of the structure they belong to.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like binary flags where certain paths through the tree determine whether a cell is filled with 0 or 1 based on conditions set at various nodes along the way.

I think I need to start by breaking down the input string into tokens and building a recursive data structure. Each node can be represented as an object with its type (number, coordinate pair, sub-structure) and children.

Once that's done, I can write a function that traverses this structure and builds the output array based on the rules inferred from examples.

But since I don't have clear rules yet, maybe trying to reverse-engineer the test example would help. Let me look at the test input:

The main node has two children: 0 with an array of arrays (like a 2D grid), and 11x11 which is probably another structure.

Then each child may have their own children, like the 11x11 node might have its own set of coordinates or sub-structures.

In the output, there's this sub-array [[0,0,...], [another row]] that's part of a larger array. So perhaps when you process a specific coordinate pair, you generate such an array with certain values based on the nodes leading to it.

Maybe each time I encounter a node with coordinates (x,y), I need to look up some value from its parent or another structure and place it in position x,y of the output grid. But then what determines the 0s and 1s? Is there a condition that decides whether to set 0 or 1 based on certain criteria?

Alternatively, perhaps each node contributes to multiple positions in the grid. For example, the number before the coordinate pair might specify how many layers deep it is, which affects where its influence is spread.

This is getting complicated without concrete rules. I think the best approach is to outline a general parsing and processing method, then see if that can be adapted based on user input or additional examples.

To address your request, we need to parse and process the provided tree structure systematically. Here's an organized breakdown:

1. **Parsing the Input**: Convert the string into a nested list structure for easier traversal.
2. **Recursive Traversal**: Use recursion to handle each node in the tree, processing children according to specific rules.
3. **Coordinate Handling**: Map coordinate pairs (e.g., 0,8) to indices in the resulting array, possibly influencing grid dimensions or values.
4. **Value Assignment**: Determine whether to place 0s or 1s based on conditions inferred from node structures.

Here's a structured approach:

```plaintext
// Pseudocode for parsing and processing

function parseTree(inputString):
    return nestedListStructure(inputString)

function processNode(node, currentDepth, outputGrid):
    if node is an array:
        for each child in node:
            newChild = processChild(child, currentDepth + 1, outputGrid)
            update outputGrid based on newChild
    else if node has coordinates (x,y):
        determine value to place at position (x,y) in outputGrid
    return outputGrid

// Example usage with test input
inputString = "0 ...", etc.
outputGrid = initializeEmptyGrid()
result = processNode(parseTree(inputString), 0, outputGrid)
```

This approach allows systematic processing of each node, ensuring that coordinates and sub-structures contribute appropriately to the final grid.
