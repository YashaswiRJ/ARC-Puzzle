User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this transformation from the input tree to the output tree works. Let me start by looking at both examples.

In the first example, the input has some nodes with different values and connections, like (4,2) which is a node connecting two children each of size 1x2. The output seems to expand these in some way—like turning [1,1] into a larger matrix or something. 

Looking at Test Example, the input tree structure is similar but has nodes with different numbers and connections. For instance, there's a (6,0) node which I guess connects two children of size 2x3 each. The output for this seems to involve more complex transformations, maybe combining multiple layers or something.

I'm not entirely sure about the rules here, but it looks like each node's value is transformed into some kind of matrix based on its connections and positions in the tree. Maybe the numbers represent how many children a node has or something related to their structure?

Wait, in the first example, there was a (4,2) node which became [[1,1]] in both input and output. Hmm, maybe it's just copying that value into a matrix? But then later on, nodes with more connections become larger matrices.

In Test Example, the (6,0) becomes a 2x3 matrix [[0,1,1],[1,1,1]], which is different from the input of [1,1]. So perhaps each node's value is transformed based on its children. Maybe it's some kind of matrix multiplication or combining matrices in a specific way.

Also, I notice that higher nodes might be aggregating information from their children. For example, the root node 0 in both examples seems to have multiple child nodes which are combined into a larger matrix for the output.

I'm thinking maybe each leaf node is transformed based on its value and then merged according to their positions in the tree. But how exactly? Maybe it's like building up layers where each layer combines information from lower layers, creating larger matrices as we go up.

Maybe I should try to map out the transformations step by step for Test Example. Let's see:

- The input has a root node 0 with children: (4,2), which is now in the output [[1,1]], and others like (5,0) becoming [1], etc.
  
Wait, maybe it's not about individual nodes but more about the entire structure being expanded. Like each level of the tree adds more layers to the matrix.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I need to think about how matrices are combined. For example, if you have two child matrices side by side, they might form a block in the parent matrix.

Looking at Test Example's output:

- The root is 6x6 with all zeros except for specific ones. Then it has several submatrices.
  
It seems like each node corresponds to a certain size of matrix and how those are placed within the larger matrices as you go up the tree.

I'm not sure about the exact rules, but perhaps I can try to reconstruct the output based on some possible transformations from the input nodes. Maybe each numerical value is turned into an identity matrix or something similar, scaled by its position in the tree.

Alternatively, maybe it's a process of expanding each node's value into a block matrix and then combining them according to their connections. So if a node has multiple children, those child matrices become submatrices within the parent's larger matrix.

This seems plausible. For instance, a (2,2) node might split its matrix into four 2x2 blocks or something like that.

I should also consider the position of each node in the tree because that affects where their matrices are placed in the output. So maybe it's about spatial arrangement as well.

To get more clarity, perhaps I can look at a specific part of the Test Example and see how its input is transformed into the output matrix.

Looking at the (2,0) node with children [[1,1]] and something else. The output for this node becomes [[0,1,1],[1,1,1]]. Hmm, maybe it's combining two matrices horizontally or vertically?

Wait, [1,1] is a 1x2 matrix. If you place another matrix next to it, maybe that results in a larger one. So if the parent has two children of size 1x3 each (since there are [[0,1,1],[1,1,1]]), perhaps they're placed side by side.

But I'm still not sure about all the rules. Maybe some nodes just copy their values into specific positions within the matrix based on their position in the tree hierarchy.

This is getting a bit too abstract without clear rules, so maybe I should look for patterns or think about similar structures used in computer science or mathematics where trees are converted to matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps this transformation has something to do with tensor products or adjacency matrices. But considering the output seems more structured and blocky, it might be closer to an adjacency matrix of some kind.

In any case, without a clear rulebook, I can only hypothesize based on these observations. Maybe each node's value is expanded into a specific type of matrix (like identity, zeros, or ones) depending on its children count and position in the tree.

I should probably stop here since my understanding is still limited by the lack of explicit rules. If I had more information or examples, it might help clarify further.

The transformation from the input tree to the output matrix appears to involve expanding each node's value into a specific matrix structure based on its connections and position within the tree. Each node contributes to the larger matrix through block matrices, where the size and placement of these blocks correspond to their hierarchical relationships in the input tree.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Node Values and Connections**: Each node in the tree has a value (like 4,2) indicating its type or properties. The connections determine how child nodes' matrices are combined.

2. **Expand Nodes into Matrices**: Each node's value is converted into a matrix. For example, certain values expand to identity matrices, zero matrices, or specific structured matrices based on predefined rules.

3. **Combine Matrices Based on Tree Structure**: Submatrices from child nodes are arranged within the parent node's matrix according to their hierarchical positions and connections.

4. **Position Matrices in Larger Matrix**: The combined submatrices form blocks within a larger matrix structure, reflecting the tree's depth and breadth.

5. **Final Assembly**: The complete output matrix is assembled by placing all submatrix blocks correctly, resulting in the transformed matrix that reflects the input tree's structure through these matrix transformations.

This process leverages the hierarchical nature of trees to create structured matrices where each node contributes specific elements based on its role within the tree hierarchy.
