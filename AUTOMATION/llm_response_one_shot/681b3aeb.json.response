User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where there are some examples of input trees and their corresponding outputs. The task is to figure out the pattern or rule that transforms the input tree into the output. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand what a "tree" means in this context. It seems like each tree has nodes with values and branches (children). For example, the first input tree starts with a node labeled 0, which has two children: another node labeled 0 and a list of numbers representing some kind of matrix or grid.

Looking at the first train example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]])
Output:
(0 (0, 0) (3x3) 0 [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] (1 (0,0) (2x3) 1 [[1,1,1],[1,0,1]) ) (3 (1,0) (2x3) 2 [[0,1,0], [1,1,1]] ))

So the input has a node with value 0, left child is another 0, right child is a 10x10 matrix filled with zeros.

The output starts similarly but ends up as a tree where:

- The root remains 0.
- Its left child is (0,0) with a size of 3x3 and the value is 0. So it becomes another node with the same structure but smaller size.
- The right part splits into two children: one has value 1, size 2x3; the other has value 3, size 2x3.

Looking at their matrices:

For the root's left child:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]
Which is a 3x3 matrix of zeros. So maybe it's taking some part of the original 10x10 matrix?

Wait, but in the input, the rightmost node was [[0,0,...], ...] which is filled with 0s except perhaps for certain patterns.

Looking at how the output matrices are structured:

- The first child after root (left) is size 3x3 and all zeros.
- Then two children: one has matrix [[1,1,1],[1,0,1]] and another with [[0,1,0], [1,1,1]]

Wait a minute, perhaps the output tree splits into sub-trees based on some criteria. Maybe it's partitioning nodes or looking for certain values.

Let me look at Example 2:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) ...)

Output is similar but with different splits and smaller matrices.

Perhaps the rule involves taking a node, splitting it into left and right subtrees based on some attribute, maybe the value of the current node or something else. Then each subtree has its own size and matrix filled in specific ways.

Looking at Test Example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) ...)

Output is given as another tree with similar structure but different splits.

Hmm, I'm noticing that the numbers like 3x3, 2x3 are appearing. It seems like it's reducing the size of the matrix each time by some factor, maybe taking square or rectangular sections from the original grid.

Wait, in all examples, the root node starts as (0 ...), but then splits into smaller sub-nodes with different sizes and matrices filled with 0s except for certain patterns.

Perhaps the transformation involves recursively splitting nodes into left and right children based on some rule related to their values or positions, while also replacing their matrices with simplified versions. Maybe each split corresponds to a specific operation or function applied to the matrix, like taking even indices, odd indices, etc., but it's unclear yet.

Another approach is to see how the outputs relate to the inputs in terms of structure and data:

- The root node always starts as 0.
- It has two children: left with (0, 0) and some size, right child varies depending on the input.
- Each subtree seems to have a matrix filled either with all zeros or specific patterns.

Wait, looking at Train Example 1's output:

The root is 0; its left child is another node of value 0 with size 3x3. The right part splits into two: one has value 1, the other 3. Their matrices are filled with 1s and some zeros depending on their positions.

In Test Example Output:
The root is 0; same as before. Its left child is another node of value 0 but now size 2x3 (since in both examples the first split seems to have a matrix of 3 columns), while the right splits into two with matrices that are 2 rows each.

So maybe, when splitting, we take certain sections or patterns from the original grid. For instance:

- The initial 10x10 grid might be split into sub-grids based on some criteria, like taking every third row and column for the left child's matrix.
- Then, in those sub-grids, perhaps certain operations are performed: setting all to zero except for specific lines or regions.

But without more examples or details on exactly how each transformation occurs, it's hard to pinpoint. However, I can try hypothesizing based on the given data:

Perhaps each time a node splits into two children (left and right), the left child takes rows 0-2 of the current grid, and the right might take other parts.

Alternatively, maybe the split is determined by some rule like taking even-indexed columns for one side or something similar.

Given that all outputs end up with matrices filled mostly with zeros but having some specific patterns (like [1,1,1], etc.), it's possible that certain positions in these sub-matrices are set to 1 based on their position relative to the parent node or other criteria.

In any case, without further information or more examples, I can only go off of what is given. The key seems to be recursively splitting nodes and transforming their associated matrices into smaller grids with specific patterns.

So my tentative understanding is:

- Each tree starts at a root node (0).
- It splits its matrix into two children based on some rule.
- Each child then has its own matrix, which can further split or remain as it is, depending on the transformation rules.
- The matrices are filled in such a way that either all elements are zero or specific patterns emerge.

This leads me to believe that the general structure of the output trees involves breaking down the initial grid into smaller sub-grids through recursive splitting and applying certain transformations (like setting certain cells to 1) based on predefined rules.

But since I'm not entirely sure about the exact transformation rule, this is as far as my analysis goes. Maybe if more examples were provided or details on how each part of the tree corresponds to specific operations, it would help in formulating a precise answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the pattern or rule that transforms the input tree into the output tree based on the given examples. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understand the Structure**: Each tree consists of nodes with values and children. The root node starts with value 0, followed by two children: another node (left) and a list representing a matrix.

2. **Analyze the Transformation**:
   - The input trees have matrices filled with zeros except for specific patterns in their outputs.
   - The output trees split into smaller sub-trees, each with its own matrix that follows certain rules (e.g., all zeros or specific 1s).

3. **Identify Splitting Rules**: 
   - Nodes split recursively, taking sections of the original grid based on criteria like row and column indices.
   - Each child node has a matrix that may be filled with patterns determined by its parent's structure.

4. **Observe Patterns in Matrices**:
   - The matrices in outputs have specific values (e.g., 1s) at certain positions, suggesting transformations based on position or operation rules.

5. **Conclude the Rule**: The transformation involves splitting nodes into sub-trees with smaller matrices that follow defined patterns and operations based on their parent's structure.

Answer: The output tree is generated by recursively splitting each node into left and right children, creating new sub-trees with smaller matrices filled according to specific rules, resulting in a structured hierarchy of nodes with transformed matrix values.
