User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Okay, so I have this input tree structure here, and it's pretty complex. Let me try to parse through it step by step.

First, the entire thing starts with a node that has a value of 0, no children (since the second element is 0), and it's part of a 15x15 grid initialized to zeros. So this looks like the root node for a 15x15 matrix where everything starts as zero.

Then, looking at the next line: (5 (0,4) (2x5) 1 [[0,1,1,1,0], [1,1,0,1,1]]). Hmm, so this is another node with a value of 5. It's connected to two children? Wait, let me break it down.

The first number after the opening parenthesis is 5, which I think represents the value or something about this node. The next part (0,4) might be coordinates or indices. Then (2x5) probably indicates the size of some matrix or array related to this node. The number 1 could mean it has one child.

Looking at the last part: [[0,1,1,1,0], [1,1,0,1,1]]. That looks like a 2x5 matrix. So maybe this node is responsible for processing these two rows of five elements each?

Then there's another similar structure: (5 (13,4) (2x5) 4 [[0,0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1,1]]). Again, value 5, coordinates (13,4), size 2x5, and it has four children? The matrix here is different from the previous one. So this node must have four children, each corresponding to some part of this 2x5 matrix.

Next up: (2 (3,3) (2x7) 2 [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], [1,0,0,0,0,0,1]]). Value is 2, coordinates (3,3), size 2x7. It has two children? The matrix here has two rows of seven elements each.

Then another node: (2 (10,3) (2x7) 3 [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1], [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]). Value 2 again, coordinates (10,3), size 2x7. It has three children? The matrix is similar but slightly different.

So putting this all together, it seems like we have a tree structure where each node represents some kind of operation or transformation on a grid. Each node takes in a value and processes its own grid based on the parameters given. The numbers after each parenthesis might represent different aspects: perhaps the node's value, its position, the size of the grid it operates on, and how many children it has.

I'm trying to visualize this as some kind of computation graph where data flows from parent nodes through their grids to child nodes until reaching leaves or something. But I'm not entirely sure what each number represents exactly—maybe the first number is the node's value, then its position, grid size, and the number of children? Or perhaps it's different.

Wait, looking again: The structure seems to be (value (coordinates) (grid size) (number of children?) [matrix]). Maybe the numbers are in a specific order. Let me think:

For example, for (0 (0, 0) (15x15) 0 [[...]]), it's value=0, position=(0,0), grid size=15x15, number of children=0? The matrix is the data.

Similarly, (5 (0,4) (2x5) 1 [[...]]) has value=5, position=(0,4), grid size=2x5, and one child. Then its matrix is two rows with five elements each.

So perhaps each node is defined by four parameters: value, coordinates, grid size, number of children, followed by the grid data which represents the actual transformation or operation it's performing on its children's outputs.

Given that structure, maybe this input tree defines a computation where multiple nodes (with their own grids) are processing data from their children recursively until reaching leaves with no further transformations. But I'm not entirely clear without more context.

I think to solve something using this tree, perhaps each node applies its matrix transformation on the results from its child nodes and passes it up to the parent. So starting from the bottom leaves, which might have simple operations or data, their outputs are passed through higher-level transformations defined by their parents until reaching the root node, which gives the final result.

But since I don't know exactly what each number represents beyond the structure, maybe the key is just to parse the tree and understand how the matrices flow from child to parent nodes. Each matrix in a node might be responsible for combining or modifying data from its children's outputs according to some rule defined by the node's value or position.

I'm also noticing that each grid size seems smaller than the root (15x15). The next level is 2x5, which are factors of 10? Not exactly. Maybe these grids represent submatrices being processed at different levels of the computation tree.

Perhaps this structure represents a hierarchical or divide-and-conquer approach where each node handles a part of the problem, breaking it down into smaller subproblems (the children nodes), solving them, and then combining the results (using their matrices) back up to solve the larger problem. This is common in algorithms like FFT or certain types of neural networks.

But again, without knowing exactly what these numbers represent, I can only speculate based on the structure. Maybe each value indicates a type of operation, coordinates denote where it's located in some space, grid size shows how big the data is at that level, and number of children tells how many subproblems it splits into.

If I were to visualize this as a tree, the root node (15x15) would have child nodes which are smaller grids like 2x5. Each of those could have their own children with even smaller grids, like 2x7 and so on. The numbers in each node's matrix might determine how data is combined from each child to form the parent's output.

So maybe each step processes some part of the input grid, breaking it down until reaching atomic operations at the leaves, then combining them back up using these transformation matrices. It could be similar to a binary tree where each node combines two subproblems into one, but in this case, nodes can have variable numbers of children based on their grid size.

I'm also thinking that since some grids are 2x5 and others are 2x7, the processing might involve overlapping or non-overlapping transformations. Maybe each matrix applies a filter over its region, updating values based on some rule from the child regions.

But honestly, without more specific information about what each part of this structure represents operationally, it's challenging to provide an exact interpretation. However, structurally, it seems like a hierarchical processing system where data flows down from leaves through parents to the root node, with each parent applying its own transformation on the results from its children.

Maybe if I were to implement something based on this tree, each node would take the outputs from its children (if any), apply some computation defined by its matrix, and pass the result up to its parent. Starting from the leaves, which have no children, their data is simply passed up through each layer until reaching the root.

In summary, parsing this input involves understanding that it's a tree with nodes containing parameters like value, coordinates, grid size, number of children, followed by matrix data. Each node processes the outputs from its children (if any) using its matrix and passes the result to its parent. The entire structure likely represents a hierarchical computation process where data is broken down and recombined according to these nodes' specifications.

But honestly, without knowing exactly what each parameter does in terms of computations or how the matrices are applied, it's hard to give a precise interpretation beyond the structural breakdown.

The input tree structure defines a hierarchical computational model where each node processes data from its children using specified transformations. Here's a summary:

1. **Root Node**: The top-level node has no value, is at position (0,0), operates on a 15x15 grid with zero children.

2. **Child Nodes**: Each subsequent node has parameters including a value, position, grid size, and number of children, followed by matrix data representing its transformation.

3. **Processing Flow**: Data flows from child nodes up to parent nodes. Each parent applies transformations defined by its matrix on the outputs from its children.

4. **Hierarchy**: The tree is hierarchical, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (child nodes) and combining results upwards (parent nodes).

5. **Matrices**: Each node's matrix specifies how data is transformed or combined from its children to form parent outputs.

6. **Structure**: Nodes can have varying grid sizes and numbers of children, suggesting a flexible hierarchical computation model.

This structure likely represents a divide-and-conquer approach, processing data through multiple levels until reaching the root for final output.
