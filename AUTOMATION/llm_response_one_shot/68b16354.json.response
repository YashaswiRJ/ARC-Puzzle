User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the given input tree corresponds to the test example. The input seems a bit complicated with all these tuples and matrices. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the initial structure:

(2 (4, 4) (2x2) 21 [[1, 1], [1, 0]])

This looks like each tuple represents something: probably a node in a tree with some attributes. The first number is maybe the index or identifier? Then there are parameters inside parentheses.

Breaking it down:

- 2: Maybe the level or type?
- (4, 4): Perhaps dimensions of something, like size.
- (2x2): Matrix size, so 2x2 matrix.
- 21: Could be a value associated with this node.
- [[1,1], [1,0]]: The actual matrix.

So maybe each tuple represents a matrix at a certain level or position in the tree. Let me see if there's a pattern here.

Looking further down:

(3 (5, 5) (2x2) 25 [[1,1],[0,1]])

Another 2x2 matrix with value 25 and matrix [[1,1], [0,1]]. Hmm, seems like each node is associated with a specific matrix size and position.

Wait, then the next one:

(7 (4, 1) (3x2) 18 [[1,0],[0,1],[1,0]])

This is a 3x2 matrix. The numbers before might be indices or coordinates in some grid system? Maybe each node's matrix depends on its position.

Moving to the Test Example:

The input tree starts with a root node: (0 (0,0) (7x7) 0 [[...]]) which has a 7x7 matrix filled with zeros. Then it branches into several children.

Looking at one branch: 

(2 (0,0) (1x1) 1 [[1]])

This is a child node at position (0,0), size 1x1 with value 1 and the matrix [[1]].

Another node:

(8 (0,1) (1x1) 2 [[1]])

Similarly, position (0,1), 1x1 matrix with value 2.

Then a more complex one:

(4 (1,0) (1x2) 8 [[1,1]])

This is at position (1,0), size 1x2, value 8, and the matrix has two ones next to each other.

So I think each tuple in the input tree represents a node with its own level, coordinates, matrix dimensions, an associated integer value, and then the actual matrix itself. The root is at position (0,0) with a 7x7 zero matrix, which might be part of a larger grid structure where nodes are placed based on their (row, column) positions.

The test example builds up from these nodes, starting from the root, each node having its own sub-nodes. It looks like some kind of graph or tree where each node can have multiple children with varying matrix sizes and values.

I need to map each part of the input to understand how they are connected in this grid. Each child node seems to be placed at specific (row, column) positions relative to their parent's position. The matrices might represent connections or weights between nodes.

Looking at another example:

(3 (0,3) (1x1) 4 [[1]])

This is a node at (0,3), size 1x1 with value 4 and matrix [1].

Further down in the test example, there are references to positions like (2,5), (3,2), etc., which probably correspond to these child nodes.

So overall, it seems that each tuple defines a node's properties: its identifier, position, size of the associated matrix, the value assigned, and then the actual matrix. The Test Example constructs such a tree starting from the root, with multiple branches, each having their own matrices at different sizes and positions.

I think I need to visualize this as a grid where each node is placed at specific (x,y) coordinates, has its own matrix size, and creates connections based on these matrices. It might be similar to building an adjacency list where each node points to others through their matrix values.

But without more context, it's challenging to precisely map how all these nodes interact. However, the key takeaway is that each tuple represents a node with specific attributes leading up to its associated matrix and position in a larger grid structure.
</think>

The given input tree consists of multiple nodes, each represented by a tuple containing various parameters such as an identifier, coordinates, matrix dimensions, an associated value, and the actual matrix. These nodes form a hierarchical or tree-like structure where each node can have children defined by their own tuples.

In the Test Example, these nodes are placed in specific positions (e.g., (0,0), (1,0)) within a grid system, with varying matrix sizes and values assigned to them. The matrices seem to represent connections or weights between nodes, creating a complex yet structured arrangement of data points.

To summarize:

- Each tuple represents a node in the tree.
- Nodes have attributes like position, matrix size, value, and an associated matrix.
- These nodes form a grid-based structure where each child's placement is relative to its parent.
- Matrices define connections or weights between nodes, creating a hierarchical data arrangement.

This setup likely models some kind of graph or tree with specific connection rules based on the matrices' values and positions.
