User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this input tree in front of me. It looks pretty complex with all these nested lists and numbers. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the main structure is a list that starts with (0 ...), which probably means something like a root node or an entry at position 0. Then there are multiple components inside this main tree: some are tuples with numbers in parentheses, others seem to be lists of lists. I remember from data structures that tuples can sometimes represent nodes in trees, especially when dealing with multi-level structures.

Looking closer, each tuple has three elements: the first is a number, then another set of parentheses which likely indicates parameters or children, and finally a list of lists. For example, one part says (0 (0, 0) (10x15) 0 ...). Hmm, maybe this represents a node with two child nodes at positions 0 and something else? The numbers like 10x15 might indicate the size or dimensions of some structure.

Wait, actually, in many tree structures, especially in functional programming languages like Haskell, tuples are used to represent data types. But here it's more about an input example for a parser or some kind of grammar. Maybe each node has attributes: the first number is the type, followed by children, and then a value.

But now I see something different: [[0, 0, 0, ...], [same as above]]. That must be a list where each element represents a possible branch from that node. So perhaps each tuple inside another tuple has its own set of branches?

The initial structure seems to have several components:
1. A main component starting with (0 ...)
2. Then there are tuples like (1 ...), which seem to represent sub-trees.
3. Each sub-tree has a number indicating type, followed by children and a list.

Let me try to outline the tree:

- The top-level node is 0, with two children: one is a component of size 5x6, another of size 2x15, and so on? Wait, not sure. Maybe it's more about the structure defined in the input.

Wait, looking again at the first part:
(0 (0, 0) (10x15) 0 [[...]]) – perhaps this is a node where type is 0, has two children: one of size 10 and another of size 15? Then it's followed by some value or list.

Wait, no. The first parameter after the opening parenthesis might be the type, then parameters, then an index, then a value. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Maybe each tuple is in the format (type [parameters] index value). So for example, (0 ... 0 [[...]]) could mean: node of type 0, no parameters, at position 0, with a value which is a list of lists.

Similarly, another part says (1 (2, 0) (2x3) 4 [[..., ...]]). So this would be a node of type 1, with two parameters (positions 2 and 0), size 2x3, index 4, value being a list of two lists each with three elements.

So perhaps the entire input is a tree where each node has its own structure: type, parameters (which might refer to other nodes in the tree or indices?), size indicating the dimensions of its associated data, an index pointing somewhere else, and a value which is another nested list.

This seems similar to some kind of abstract syntax tree but with more specific attributes. Maybe it's for parsing purposes where each node defines how child nodes are structured based on their type.

Looking at this input:
- The main root is 0
    - It has two children: one starting with (1 ...) and another with (2 ...)
        Wait, let me look again:

The full input is:
(0 (0, 0) (10x15) 0 [[...]]) 
Then inside that, a subtree of type 1 at position 6, which has two children: positions 7 and something else.
Wait, actually, the exact structure seems too complicated. Maybe I should try to map it as per the given notation.

Let me parse this step by step:

The main tuple is (0 ...). Breaking it down:
- First number: 0
- Then a part in parentheses: (0, 0) – maybe parameters?
- Then another part in parentheses with "10x15" which could be size
- Then index: 0
- Then value: [[...]]

So node type 0, no parameters, at position 0, value is a list where each element corresponds to a child.

The value for this node is a list of two lists. The first sublist is [0,0,0,...15 times], which would be the children associated with this node? So maybe each entry in this sublist refers to another sub-tree or data structure.

Then inside that 10x15 list:
- At position 6: (1 ...). Breaking down this tuple.
    - Type 1
    - Parameters (2,0)
    - Size (2x3) – so a 2-dimensional array of size 2 rows by 3 columns?
    - Index 4
    - Value [[5..], [7..]]

So for node type 1 at index 6, with parameters 2 and 0. The value is two lists: first list starts with 5 repeated six times (since the given part was [5x6]), second list is a mixture starting with 7... maybe?

Wait, perhaps each of these nested tuples represents nodes in a tree where type determines how many children they have or what kind of data they hold. The numbers inside could represent indices into their own lists.

Looking at another subtree: (1 ...). Inside this, we see more sub-trees:
- One is (2 ...) with parameters 7 and something else.
Wait, maybe it's too convoluted without a clear structure.

Perhaps the best way is to create an abstract representation:

Start with type 0 at index 0. It has children which are at positions defined by its value list. The first child could be at position 6: a node of type 1 with parameters (2,0), size 2x3, index 4, and value [[5x6], [7...]].

Then another subtree starting at position maybe something else? Or is it the same?

Wait, perhaps each nested tuple represents an array element where its children are accessed via indices. So for example:

- The main node (0 ...), type 0, no params, index 0.
    - Its value is a list of two elements: first at position 6 and second? Maybe it's more than that.

Wait, perhaps each number in the nested lists represents an array dimension, so [10x15] would mean a 2D array with 10 rows and 15 columns. Then inside this, nodes are placed at specific indices (like position 6) which point to their respective sub-trees.

This is getting really tangled. Maybe I should consider that each node has an index within its own structure, so when the value list says [something], it refers to positions in a larger array where sub-nodes are located.

Alternatively, maybe this represents some kind of graph or linked list where nodes point to other nodes via their indices.

I think without more context on what exactly this input tree is supposed to represent (like parsing expressions, syntax trees, etc.), it's hard to map accurately. But perhaps the key is to understand that each tuple defines a node with certain attributes: type, parameters, size (dimensions), index within its own structure, and value which can be another nested list.

So in summary, this input tree likely represents a hierarchical structure where each node has:
- A type
- Parameters (which could map to child nodes or other structures)
- Dimensions (size) indicating the scope of data it holds
- An index pointing within its own array/list
- And a value which is another nested list defining its children.

Each subtree can be further analyzed by breaking down these components, understanding how they relate to each other based on their indices and sizes. Without a clear mapping or schema, it's challenging to provide an exact interpretation, but structurally, this seems like a complex nested data structure where nodes define the layout and content of their child structures.

Perhaps visualizing it would help, with each tuple representing a node and its children as elements in the value list. But since I can't draw here, maybe just following the hierarchy:

- Top-level: Node 0
    - Value is a list containing sub-nodes at positions defined by indices within this structure.
        E.g., first element might point to another subtree starting at position 6.

This way, each node's value list acts as an array of pointers to other nodes in the overall tree. Each pointer's index corresponds to where that child node is located within the parent's data structure.

So for example:
- Node 0 (type 0) has a value list [sub_node1, sub_node2]
    - Sub_node1 starts at position x and has its own attributes
    - Sub_node2 starts at position y

Each of these sub_nodes would then define their own structures similarly.

In conclusion, this input is likely a representation of a tree where each node's structure is defined by specific parameters and the layout of its child nodes within an array-like structure. To parse it completely, one would need to systematically traverse each node according to its index in the value list and build out the entire tree accordingly.

The input represents a hierarchical or nested data structure, likely used for parsing or representing syntactic elements with specific types, parameters, dimensions, indices, and values. Each tuple defines a node with attributes that determine its position and content within the overall structure.

$\boxed{\text{A complex nested data structure representing nodes with defined types, parameters, dimensions, indices, and child structures}}$
