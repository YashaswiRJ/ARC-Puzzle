User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided some input and output trees, but it's a bit confusing at first glance. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the initial example, the input seems to be in a specific format that includes numbers, parentheses, letters like 'x' and '(', ')', and brackets with commas and numbers inside. The output is another tree structure that looks somewhat similar but has different numbers and configurations. It appears that each part of the input tree corresponds to parts of the output tree.

The user also provided a test example with an input and an expected output tree. Comparing this test example to the initial one, I notice some similarities in how the numbers are structured within parentheses. The numbers seem to represent different components like node values, dimensions, or something related to matrix sizes based on the "x" notation.

I think the task here is to understand how each part of the input translates into the output tree. Each element inside the first parenthesis might be a subtree that needs to be processed in a specific way to generate parts of the larger tree structure seen in the output.

Looking at the test example, I can see that the initial number (0) corresponds to an array filled with zeros, which is then used as part of constructing the subtrees. The subsequent numbers like 1 and 2 seem to represent node values or identifiers for different parts of the tree. The "x" likely denotes dimensions, so something like 10x10 might mean a 10-element by 10-element matrix.

Each subtree within parentheses seems to follow a pattern where they have their own set of numbers and structures nested inside them. For example, in both examples, there's an entry with "3 [[1, 1], [1, 1]]", which probably represents a node with value 3 and two child nodes each containing a matrix or another structure.

I'm also noticing that the numbers after some parentheses seem to correspond to the number of elements or dimensions in certain matrices. For instance, (2x2) might indicate a 2x2 matrix, and similarly for other sizes like 10x10, 3x3, etc.

To approach this problem systematically, I'll need to parse both the input and output trees to understand how each part maps to another. It seems that the output tree is built by processing each element of the input tree recursively, transforming numbers into corresponding structures as specified.

Given that, my task would be to replicate or validate this transformation process so that when given any input tree in the same format, I can generate the correct output tree following the established pattern.

I should also consider how the different parts like node values, matrix dimensions, and child nodes interact. For example, a parent node with value 3 might have two children each representing matrices of certain sizes or other structures that need to be included in the final output.

Another thing I notice is the use of arrays within the input, such as [[1, 0], [1, 1]] which could represent layers or sections in the matrix structure. Each array level probably adds a new dimension to the overall tree structure.

I should also look out for any patterns or rules that dictate how each number and array translates into parts of the output. For instance, maybe certain numbers indicate the size of matrices or determine where sub-nodes are placed within the larger structure.

It's crucial to ensure consistency between the input and output structures so that every corresponding element is accurately represented in the final tree. Any discrepancies could lead to errors in the generated output.

Additionally, I need to be cautious about nested structures. Each time a subtree is encountered within parentheses, it needs to be processed independently before being integrated into its parent node's structure.

In summary, my approach would involve:

1. Parsing the input tree to identify each node and its associated data.
2. Recursively processing each node according to predefined rules for transforming numbers into corresponding structures in the output tree.
3. Building the output tree by combining all processed nodes appropriately, ensuring that nesting and dimensional information are accurately represented.
4. Validating the final output against expected results to ensure correctness.

By following this structured approach, I should be able to effectively translate any given input tree into its corresponding output tree format as demonstrated in the examples.

The user has provided two examples of input trees and their corresponding outputs. The task is to understand how these trees are transformed and generate a similar output for any given input.

### Input Tree:
1, 0]] )

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], (1x3) (2x2), (3x2)) 

### Test Example:
Input Tree:
User:,

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0], [0, 0]] ), 
(0 (1, 1) (1x3) 0 [[0, 1], [0, 0]]) , 
(2 (2, 1) (1x3) 0 [[0, 0]]) 

### Explanation:
The input tree consists of nodes with values and dimensions. Each node is represented by a tuple containing the node's value followed by its dimensions in parentheses. The output tree is built based on these nodes, where each node's data corresponds to parts of the output structure.

For example:
- In the test case, the node (1, 1) refers to a matrix with one row and one column.
- Each subsequent part of the tree builds upon this information to create nested structures.

### Conclusion:
To generate an output tree for any given input tree:
1. Parse each node's value and dimensions from the input.
2. Create corresponding nested structures in the output based on these values and dimensions.
3. Ensure that all nodes are correctly represented, including their positions within the larger structure.

By following this method, you can accurately transform any input tree into its corresponding output tree format.
