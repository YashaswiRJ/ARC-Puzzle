User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this big expression here with a lot of numbers and some sub-expressions. It looks kind of complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure out what's going on.

First, let me see the structure. The main part is something like (number (indices) (shape) [[contents]]). So each of these parentheses starts with a number, then has some stuff in parentheses, followed by another set of parentheses for the shape, and then the contents inside double brackets.

Looking at the first one: 1 (0,2) (1x1) [ [1] ]. Hmm, so maybe this is indicating that we have a matrix or something with size (1x1), which is just a single element, and it's 1. So I guess each of these parts represents some kind of entry in a larger structure.

The next one is 3 (0,9) (1x1) [5]. Wait, but there are multiple numbers here—like 2, 4, etc.—so maybe this is building up another matrix or array with more elements. It seems like each number corresponds to an entry in a grid.

I'm noticing that the entries seem to be arranged in some kind of coordinate system. The parts like (0,2), (1,0), etc., might represent row and column indices for a two-dimensional array. But there are also numbers like 5, which is larger than 1x1. Maybe these are sub-matrices or something.

Looking at the shape part: some of them are just (1x1), but others have bigger shapes like 2x2 with [0,1;1,0]. That matrix looks familiar—it's a swap matrix or an exchange matrix. It swaps rows or columns when multiplied.

Then there's another number and indices, like (4,10) for entry 16 [[1]], which is part of a 5x5 grid? Wait, maybe each coordinate corresponds to a position in a multi-dimensional array. Let me think about how these numbers are arranged.

It might help if I try to visualize this as coordinates in some space. The first number could be the index, then (0,2) could represent row and column indices for that element's location in a grid. Then each subsequent part is adding more dimensions or layers.

But honestly, it's getting pretty confusing. There are multiple levels here—like different indices and shapes within shapes. Maybe I should try to parse this as nodes in a graph where each entry points to its neighbors based on the matrices provided.

Also, seeing that there are 1x1 blocks with simple values like [[1]] or more complex swap matrices is making me think it's building up some kind of tensor structure. Tensors can have multiple dimensions and their entries are accessed via multi-dimensional indices.

Another thought: perhaps each entry corresponds to a node in a graph, and the shape part defines how nodes connect to each other—like edges between nodes with certain weights (the 1s or 0s). The swap matrix might indicate some kind of connection that swaps positions or something like that.

But I'm not sure if it's exactly what I think. Maybe these are entries in a graph laplacian matrix, where the diagonal is degrees and the off-diagonal indicates connections. But then why all the sub-expressions?

Wait, maybe each number represents a different part of an adjacency matrix or something similar. The swap matrices could be indicating specific types of edges.

Alternatively, this might represent some kind of cellular automaton or state transitions with these indices defining next states based on current ones.

This is getting too abstract for me. Maybe I should focus on smaller parts. Let's pick the first few entries:

1 (0,2) (1x1) [ [1] ]

3 (0,9) (1x1) [5]

And then maybe look at what 5 refers to—maybe another part of the structure?

But without knowing the overall context or purpose, it's hard for me to figure out exactly what this represents. It might be a mathematical model, an algorithm step, or something else entirely.

Perhaps if I think about how these numbers are incrementing and where they're placed in coordinate systems, there could be a pattern emerging when laid out correctly. But without visualizing the entire structure, it's challenging to see.

Another angle: perhaps each of these is part of a larger matrix decomposition or transformation where each number corresponds to an eigenvalue or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe this is code for generating some kind of grid or map with specific properties—like certain areas being blocked or having different weights based on the matrices provided.

Wait, if I look at how many numbers there are: from 1 up to 33. It's a lot. Maybe it's building up a large matrix where each cell is defined by these operations or references.

But honestly, without more context, my ability to interpret this expression is limited. There are just too many unknowns about what the numbers and shapes represent. If I had information on whether this is for solving a system of equations, graph theory, linear algebra, etc., it might help me parse it better.

In summary, I think each part represents an entry in some multi-dimensional structure where coordinates determine its position, and matrices define connections or properties between these entries. The swap matrix indicates something about the connectivity—maybe symmetric relationships or specific transformations.

But without knowing the exact framework or purpose of this expression, my analysis is stuck. Maybe if I try to group similar numbers together based on their indices, patterns might emerge that would help me understand how they interrelate.

Alternatively, focusing on each coordinate and its corresponding shape: (0,2) with 1x1 matrix [1], then another entry at (3,9) with a different matrix. It's like the entire structure is being built up by referencing other parts through these coordinates.

Maybe it's helpful to think of this as a recursive or iterative process where each new entry builds upon the previous ones using some rule defined by the shape matrices. But again, without knowing the rules, it's hard.

In any case, I think my approach should be:

1. Identify all individual components: numbers (indices), shapes, and contents.
2. Try to map how these components relate to each other in a structural sense.
3. Look for patterns or recurring elements that might indicate their purpose—like swap matrices suggesting some form of connectivity or transformation.

Even though I can't pinpoint exactly what this represents without more context, breaking it down into its components gives me some handle on the problem. Hopefully, with further analysis or information, these pieces will fit together.

The expression provided is a complex structure involving multiple indices and sub-expressions, likely representing a multi-dimensional array or tensor with specific connections defined by matrices such as swap matrices. Each number corresponds to an entry within this structure, and their positions are indicated by coordinate pairs along with associated shapes that define the relationships between these entries.

To summarize:

1. **Indices**: The first part of each expression indicates the position in a multi-dimensional grid or array using coordinates like (0,2) or (4,10).
2. **Shapes**: These describe the structure of sub-arrays or matrices, such as 1x1 blocks containing values or swap matrices.
3. **Content**: The double brackets enclose the actual data within each entry.

The presence of a swap matrix suggests that some entries are connected in specific ways, possibly indicating symmetric relationships or transformations between positions. However, without additional context about the purpose or framework of this structure (e.g., graph theory, linear algebra, etc.), further analysis is limited.

The overall expression likely builds up a complex multi-dimensional array with intricate connections and properties defined by its sub-expressions.
