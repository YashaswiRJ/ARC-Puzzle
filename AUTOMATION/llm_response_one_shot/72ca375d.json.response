User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It seems like there's some kind of tree structure involved with matrices or arrays attached to nodes. The input trees have these numbers in parentheses that probably represent dimensions and other attributes.

Looking at the first example, the input is a tree where each node has two children. The leaves are labeled with 0s or something else? Hmm, maybe those are labels for something like class assignments or data points. Each internal node seems to combine its children's data in some way.

In the output trees from the examples, it looks like the structure of the tree is being modified based on certain rules. For instance, in the first test case, the 10x10 matrix at the root is somehow transformed into a 2x4 matrix with another set of numbers attached.

Wait, let me see: The initial node has attributes (10x10) and then two children. One child becomes (3x2), which further splits into smaller matrices. In the output, it's changed to (2x4) instead of 10x10? That suggests that maybe we're taking some kind of maximum or minimum across certain dimensions.

Looking at how the matrices are structured: for example, in the first test case, after processing, the root node becomes a 2x4 matrix with [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]. The children nodes have their own transformations as well. So maybe each internal node is combining its child matrices by taking either the minimum or maximum values in some way.

Another thought: perhaps it's about merging two child matrices into a parent matrix by selecting specific rows and columns based on certain criteria. For example, if one child has more data points, we might take only a subset of those for the parent node.

But how exactly? The user mentioned that the output is given but didn't specify the exact rules. Without clear instructions, it's hard to automate this process. Maybe I need to reverse-engineer what transformations are happening from the input to the output trees.

Looking at Input Tree 1:
- Root has a (0,0) label and a 2x4 matrix.
- It has two children: one is 3x2 with [[1,1],[0,1],[0,1]], and another is 5x4 with [[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].

In Output Tree:
- Root becomes (0) (I think this might be a misrepresentation or maybe it's simplified), but the key part is that one of its children has changed to 2x4 matrix: [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]], and another child remains as is.

Wait, no. Actually, looking closer:
In Output Tree 1, it's (0 (0,0) (2x4) 0 [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]] (5 ...)). So the root now has a size of 2x4 instead of whatever it was before.

But how does that happen? It seems like we're taking one child's matrix and using its values for the parent. Maybe the parent is just one of the children?

Alternatively, maybe each node can either keep or combine with its children based on some condition. In this case, perhaps only one child is kept as part of the output.

But that doesn't make sense because in Output Tree 2, both (3 and 5) are present but their sizes have changed. Maybe it's about merging multiple nodes' data into a parent node by selecting specific features or attributes.

Another idea: Each internal node might be representing some kind of grouping or aggregation of its child nodes. For example, taking the minimum value from each dimension across all children to form the parent matrix.

Looking at Input Tree 1:
- Child 3x2 has [[1,1],[0,1],[0,1]].
- Child 5x4 has [[1,0,0,1], [1,1,1,1]].

If we take the minimum for each position across these two matrices, it might not make sense because they are of different dimensions. Alternatively, maybe only one child is being kept based on some condition like maximum value or something else.

Wait, in Output Tree 1, under (2x4), there's a [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]. So both rows have zeros. How does that happen?

Perhaps the parent node is taking zero where all children have zero in that position across their matrices. Or maybe it's selecting specific rows or columns.

Alternatively, maybe each leaf contributes to a certain part of its parent matrix based on some attribute like its value range.

Wait, let me see what the user provided:

They showed Test Example Input and Output. The input has (0) with two children: one is 10x10 with labels? Wait no, actually in the input trees, each node seems to have a label, then parentheses for something else, then another label.

Wait, maybe it's better if I parse that:

In Input Tree 1:
- Root: (0) (something else?) Then has two children. The first child is labeled (3x2), which probably represents the matrix size as 3 rows and 2 columns with some internal values. Similarly, the second child is (5x4).

Wait no, looking at Input Tree 1:
- Root: (0) then a structure that goes to two children: one is (3x2) and another is (5x4). But in Output Tree 1, root becomes (0)(something else)(2x4). So the parent node now has size 2x4.

So maybe when processing, each internal node merges its child nodes into a new matrix based on some criteria. Maybe it's taking either one of them or combining their matrices by selecting certain rows and columns that meet specific conditions.

But without knowing exactly what operation is being performed, it's challenging to provide an exact algorithm.

Alternatively, perhaps the size transformations are determined by the maximum value in each dimension across children nodes. For example:

In Input Tree 1:
- First child: (3x2)
- Second child: (5x4)

The root becomes (max(3,5) x max(2,4)) = (5x4). But in Output Tree 1, the root is (2x4), which doesn't align with that.

Alternatively, maybe taking minimums. Min(3,5)=3 and min(2,4)=2, so 3x2. But output has 2x4, which still doesn't fit.

Wait, looking at Output Tree 1: Root is (0) then a structure of size 2x4 with two children: one labeled (3x2) and another (5x4). So the parent node's matrix is somehow combining these children. Maybe it's taking rows from both matrices? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each leaf contributes to certain parts of its parents based on their labels.

This seems too vague without clear rules. Therefore, maybe I should consider that this transformation process isn't standard and requires more information or context.

Given that the user has provided examples with input and output trees, but not specified what operations are being performed (like transposing matrices, taking submatrices, merging rows/columns based on conditions), it's hard to reverse-engineer the exact method.

Perhaps each internal node is somehow combining its child nodes' dimensions by selecting either all children's minimum or maximum across certain axes. But without knowing which axis or how they are combined, this remains speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the parent matrix is built from one of the children selected based on some criteria like highest value in a specific position.

Another possibility: Maybe each internal node in the output tree corresponds to an external node in the input tree, and their matrices are being merged by appending rows or columns. But again, this isn't clear without more information.

In conclusion, without explicit rules for how the transformation from input to output trees occurs, it's difficult to provide a precise step-by-step explanation or algorithm. The key operations could involve merging, selecting, or aggregating data across child nodes in non-trivial ways that aren't standard matrix operations.

To solve this problem, we need to transform an input tree structure into an output tree by modifying the dimensions and attributes of each node based on specific rules. However, without explicit instructions on how these transformations occur (e.g., whether it involves taking maximums, minimums, or merging matrices in certain ways), it's challenging to provide a precise algorithm.

Given the complexity and ambiguity in the transformation rules, here is a general approach that could be applied:

1. **Parse the Input Tree**: Extract each node's attributes, including its label, dimensions, and any attached data.
2. **Define Transformation Rules**: Establish clear rules for how nodes are transformed. This might involve selecting specific children, combining matrices based on certain criteria (like maximum or minimum values), or modifying dimensions in a predefined manner.
3. **Apply Transformations Recursively**: Process each node from the leaves up to the root, applying the defined transformation rules at each step.
4. **Generate Output Tree**: Construct the output tree based on the transformed nodes.

If you can provide more specific details about how the transformations are supposed to occur, a more accurate algorithm can be developed.
