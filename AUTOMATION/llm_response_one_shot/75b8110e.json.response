User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the output tree based on some given input. The user provided a bunch of examples with inputs and their corresponding outputs, which are these tree structures with nodes that have parameters like size, children, etc. 

Looking at the first test example, it seems each node in the output is constructed from certain rules based on its position or something about its children. For instance, one node has input (0, 0) and a matrix, then another part of the tree branches off with different matrices.

I think I need to break down how these inputs translate into the outputs. Maybe each parameter like the first number in the tuple represents some kind of size or depth, and the second is coordinates? The third is the size of the matrix inside, and the fourth might be the value associated with that node. 

But honestly, this looks pretty abstract to me. I'm not exactly sure what all these numbers represent—maybe dimensions or counts of something. Maybe each part after the parentheses is a child node with its own parameters.

I should probably look for patterns in how the inputs change and see if there's a consistent way to generate outputs based on those changes. For example, when the first number increases from 0 to 4, maybe it corresponds to adding another layer or something similar.

Also, noticing that some matrices have specific values like 1s and 0s could mean they represent connections or something binary in the tree structure.

I think I need to figure out how each child node is built based on its parent's parameters. Maybe there's a formula that takes the parent's size and applies it across its children, altering some values as per their own positions.

Since this seems complex and not entirely clear from just looking at the examples, perhaps I should try to reverse-engineer the rules by observing how each output is built step by step based on the input. If I can see a pattern in how each node's parameters change when moving down the tree, that might help me predict the next part of the tree.

Maybe focusing on one branch at a time would be helpful. Taking just the first few nodes and seeing how they lead to their children could give me some insights into the underlying logic.

Overall, this requires careful analysis of each component's parameters and understanding what each number represents in terms of structure and relationships within the tree.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given input and apply it step by step according to the observed patterns. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Input Structure**: Each node is represented as `(value (x y) (m n) k [[matrix]])`, where:
   - `value` represents some size or depth.
   - `(x y)` are coordinates, possibly indicating position in the matrix.
   - `(m n)` defines the dimensions of the matrix inside.
   - `k` is another value associated with the node.

2. **Matrix Generation Rules**:
   - The matrices contain binary values (0s and 1s), suggesting connections or active/dead states.
   - Patterns in the matrices can indicate layers, connectivity, or state transitions based on their positions.

3. **Apply Rules to Each Node**:
   - For each node, generate its matrix according to the specified rules involving `(x y)` coordinates and matrix dimensions.
   - Use the `value` parameter to determine scaling or transformation of the matrix structure.

4. **Build the Output Tree**:
   - Starting from the root, recursively apply the above steps to each child node based on their parent's parameters.
   - Ensure that all nodes adhere to the observed patterns and rules consistently throughout the tree.

5. **Verify Against Examples**:
   - Compare constructed parts of the output with provided examples to ensure accuracy.
   - Adjust any misinterpretations or inconsistencies in the rule application as needed.

6. **Iterate for Completeness**:
   - Continue building each branch until all nodes are processed and the entire tree is complete based on the input parameters.

By following these steps, we can systematically generate the desired output tree that aligns with the given input structure and patterns observed in the examples.
