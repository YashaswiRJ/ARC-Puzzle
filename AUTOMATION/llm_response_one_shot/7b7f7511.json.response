User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color

Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to transform an input tree into an output tree based on some rules. The user provided examples with their inputs and corresponding outputs, which might help me figure out the pattern or the transformation logic.

First, looking at the structure of these trees, they seem to consist of nodes that have children. Each node has a value, a list of children (which themselves are nodes), and possibly some additional data like matrices associated with them. The input tree is given in a specific format with numbers and parentheses, representing values, child nodes, and matrix data.

In the first example, the input starts with a root node that's part of an 8x3 structure, followed by several child nodes each contributing to different parts of the output. The output seems to be merging some of these children or aggregating their data into a new tree structure.

Looking at the differences between Input Tree 1 and Output Tree 1:

- The root node in the input is (0 (0, 0) (3x3) ...), while in the output it's still present but now with children that seem to be simplified or combined. For example, one child was originally a large structure with multiple branches, but in the output, it's reduced to just two nodes.

Another key point is how matrices are handled. In Input Tree 1, there's a matrix like [[0, 0, 0], ...] and several other matrices attached to different children. The output tree seems to aggregate these into fewer nodes with their own simplified matrices or no matrices at all.

Now looking at the second example, Input Tree 2 has more complex branching, especially in the middle parts where there are multiple child nodes with varying depths. The output is simpler, merging some of these branches and consolidating matrix data.

For Test Example: The input tree here seems to be significantly larger, with many layers of children. The output is again simplified but retains some structure similar to the previous examples.

So, from these observations, it appears that the transformation involves:

1. Simplifying or aggregating child nodes at each level.
2. Reducing matrix data in a way that might involve taking averages, maximums, or just removing unnecessary elements.
3. Possibly merging sibling nodes if they have similar structures or can be combined without losing essential information.

I need to figure out the exact rules for these transformations since different parts of the tree are being altered differently. For instance, some branches are collapsed into single nodes in the output, while others retain their matrix data but with fewer elements.

Perhaps each level reduces the number of child nodes by combining adjacent or similar ones and simplifies the associated matrices accordingly. The exact method could involve taking the first few children at a certain depth to form new nodes or calculating some aggregate function over the matrix values.

I might also need to consider that when moving from an 8x3 structure in the input to a 3x3 in the output, each dimension is being scaled down by a factor related to the number of children being merged. For example, going from 8 levels to 3 could mean grouping multiple layers into one.

To handle this systematically, I should outline step-by-step transformation rules based on these examples:

1. At each node level, group consecutive child nodes if they are at the same depth.
2. Each group of children will form a new node in the output tree with their combined matrix data, possibly aggregated by taking certain elements or applying an operation like summing or averaging across rows or columns.
3. Continue this process recursively until all levels have been reduced to single nodes or as per some stopping criteria.

I might also need to adjust for varying matrix sizes and ensure that each node's matrix is appropriately resized based on the new structure. For example, if a parent had multiple children with matrices of size 2x1, after grouping they might reduce to a single 2x2 matrix where only specific elements are kept or combined.

Additionally, I should verify how exactly the output tree is structured in terms of node values and their child relationships. It looks like each root node's children determine the next level of nodes, which then have their own children until leaves with no further structure.

Another point to consider is that some matrices are completely removed from the output. For instance, in Input Tree 1, there was a matrix [[2]] attached to a child, but in Output Tree 1, this might not appear explicitly unless it's part of the new node's data.

Overall, my approach would be:

- Parse both input and output trees to understand their structures.
- Identify patterns in how nodes are grouped or merged between input and output examples.
- Derive transformation rules based on these patterns, considering how matrix data is altered.
- Implement these rules programmatically, ensuring that each node's children are processed according to the identified logic.

Potential challenges might include correctly handling variable depths of trees and appropriately resizing matrices while preserving essential information. Also, ensuring that all edges cases (like single-child nodes or leaf nodes) are handled properly during transformation.

To test my understanding, I can examine more examples, maybe create some hypothetical input outputs and see if they follow the same logic as in the given cases. This might help in refining the transformation rules further.

The problem involves transforming an input tree into an output tree by simplifying or aggregating child nodes at each level while reducing matrix data appropriately. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

1. **Parse Input and Output Trees**: Understand the structure of both trees, noting how nodes are grouped and matrices are associated with them.

2. **Identify Transformation Patterns**: Observe how nodes in the input tree correspond to nodes in the output tree, focusing on child grouping and matrix resizing.

3. **Derive Transformation Rules**:
   - **Node Grouping**: At each level, group consecutive child nodes into new nodes based on depth.
   - **Matrix Aggregation**: Simplify matrices by selecting specific elements or applying operations like averaging across rows/columns to form new node matrices.
   
4. **Recursive Application**: Apply these rules recursively from root to leaves, ensuring all levels are reduced appropriately.

5. **Handle Variable Matrix Sizes and Depths**: Adjust for varying matrix sizes by resizing them based on the simplified tree structure, preserving essential information.

6. **Implement Transformation Rules**: Develop a systematic approach to process each node's children according to identified logic, including handling matrices.

**Final Answer**:

The transformation involves simplifying child nodes at each level into new nodes and reducing matrix data through aggregation or selection of specific elements. The output tree is generated by recursively applying these rules from the root down, resulting in a simplified structure that retains essential information while grouping multiple layers into fewer nodes.
