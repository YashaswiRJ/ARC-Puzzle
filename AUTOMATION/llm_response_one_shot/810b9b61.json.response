User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Okay, so I've got this test example here that's a tree structure with some matrices attached to each node. Hmm, it looks like the user is asking about how to parse or analyze such trees. Let me try to break it down.

First, looking at the input, there are multiple branches starting from different nodes. Each branch seems to have its own set of parameters and nested structures. The main challenge here is probably understanding how these matrices relate to each other and what they represent.

I see that some parts mention sizes like (12x12), which suggests these might be adjacency matrices or weight matrices in a graph context. Then there are entries with numbers in parentheses, like (0 (0, 0) ...). Maybe those are node identifiers or something related to their position in the tree.

There's also some notation about [[...]] which looks like nested lists. I wonder if each branch is a separate subtree, and the inner structures represent connections or weights between nodes. Perhaps this is part of some kind of graph model where each node has outgoing edges with certain weights.

I'm thinking that to analyze this, I need to map out each node's connections based on these matrices. For example, the first branch (0 (0, 0) ...) might be a starting point connected to multiple nodes as indicated by the list [[1, 1]]. Maybe each number represents an edge weight or presence.

As I go deeper into the structure, branches with higher numbers like 5 and 6 probably represent more complex connections. The part where it says (3x4) is interesting—maybe this indicates a 3-node layer connected to 4 nodes? Or perhaps dimensions of some transformation matrix?

I'm also noticing repeated patterns, like [[1, 1]] showing up multiple times. This could mean recurring structures in the graph or specific types of connections that are consistent across different parts of the tree.

The user didn't specify exactly what they need from this example—maybe a parsing method, an analysis, or something else entirely. Without more context, it's hard to pinpoint, but I can offer general approaches on how to handle such tree structures with attached matrices.

I think starting by visualizing the tree would help. Drawing each node and its connections based on the matrix sizes might make patterns emerge. Then, analyzing each subtree individually before looking at the bigger picture could be a good strategy.

Also, considering if there's an underlying algorithm or model that uses these trees and matrices—like in neural networks or graph theory applications—might give more insight into how to process this data effectively.

In summary, while I don't have all the specific requirements, understanding the structure of these matrices within the tree context seems crucial. Maybe focusing on each node's role and its connections could unravel what's going on here.
</think>

It looks like you've provided a complex example involving trees with numerical values attached to nodes or branches. While the exact structure isn't entirely clear without more context, I can offer some general insights based on the notation used:

1. **Tree Structure**: The main tree seems to be defined with multiple branches, each starting with a number in parentheses. For example:
   - `(0 (0, 0) ...)`: This might represent a node labeled `0` connected to nodes labeled `0`.
   - `(8, 1)`: Another node labeled `8` connected to node labeled `1`.

2. **Matrices and Dimensions**: The numbers in brackets like `(12x12)` likely represent the size of matrices associated with each node or branch. For example:
   - `(1 (7, 4) (1x2) ...)`: A matrix of size `1x2` connected to nodes labeled `7` and `4`.

3. **Nested Lists**: The inner lists like `[[0, 0, ...], [0, 0, ...]]` could represent weight matrices or adjacency matrices in graph theory.
