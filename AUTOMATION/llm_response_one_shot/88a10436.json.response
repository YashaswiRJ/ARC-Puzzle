User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here that involves something called a "tree" and some kind of operations on it. Looking at the input, there's a lot of numbers and parentheses with what look like parameters inside them. It seems pretty complex, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense.

First off, let me try to understand what each part represents. The main structure is something that looks like (number (parameters) ...). Maybe the first number is the node's value or some identifier? Then inside the parentheses, there are parameters separated by commas. Perhaps these represent children nodes or some kind of edges connecting them.

Looking at the input example: 

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x8) 0 [[0, 0, ..., 0], ...])

And another part with:

(5 (2, 4) (1x1) 4 [[1]] )

Hmm, okay. Maybe the first number after the opening parenthesis is the node's value or something like that. Then there are parameters in parentheses: maybe dimensions? For example, (10x8) could mean a matrix of size 10x8.

Wait, but then later on, I see numbers like 2 (1,3), which might represent something else. Maybe each node has a certain number of children or edges connecting to other nodes with specific properties.

Also, there are these brackets with lists inside them, like [[1]], which could be arrays representing some kind of data structure connected to the nodes.

I'm noticing that after the initial numbers and parameters, there's another set of parentheses. Maybe each part represents a subtree or a branch in the main tree.

Let me try to parse one of these examples:

Take the first input line:
(0 (0, 0) (10x8) 0 [[0,0,...,0], ...])

So starting with 0, which is probably the node's value. Then inside parentheses: parameters are (0, 0), maybe indicating something about its children or edges. The next part is (10x8), perhaps the dimensions of some matrix associated with this node.

Then another number 0 and [[0s]], which could be a list of arrays representing connections to child nodes.

Wait, but in the example output given later on, it's structured as:

(2 (1,3) ... ) etc. Maybe each main node has sub-nodes connected via these parameters.

I think I need to figure out what each component represents. Let me try to see if there are any patterns.

Looking at the first test example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (10x11) ... )

Then inside parentheses after that: [ [0s], ..., [0s] ], which is a list of 10 arrays each with 11 zeros. Maybe this represents some kind of matrix or adjacency list.

The numbers like (5 (2,4) (1x1) 4 [[1]] ) might indicate specific nodes within the main tree structure. The first number inside each parenthesis could be the node's identifier, then the next parameters describe its connections and properties.

But honestly, without a clear definition of what all these components mean, it's challenging to map them correctly. It seems like this is some kind of tree representation where each node has certain attributes and relationships defined by the numbers and arrays within the parentheses.

Maybe I should try to look for any patterns or commonalities between the input and output trees. For example, in the first test case:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) ... ) 
Then inside that, another subtree: (5 (2,4)...)

In the Output tree, it's structured with nodes like 2 connected to 1, which is connected further down.

Perhaps each number represents a node identifier, and the parameters after it define how many children or specific connections it has. The arrays within might represent child nodes or edges connecting to them.

I'm also noticing that some subtrees have dimensions specified, like (10x8) or (2x1), which could indicate matrices of certain sizes related to each node's properties.

But honestly, I think without more context on what exactly this notation represents—like whether it's a graph, tree structure with specific attributes, adjacency lists, etc.—it's hard for me to pin down the exact mapping. 

Maybe if I consider that the first number is the node value, followed by parameters describing its children or connections. Then inside the next parentheses are arrays of zeros, perhaps indicating some kind of binary state or presence/absence in connections.

Alternatively, the numbers could represent node IDs, and the following parameters define their type or relationship type to other nodes.

In any case, it seems like a recursive structure where each node can have multiple children defined by these parameters. The arrays within might be lists of child nodes or edges connected to that node.

Given all this uncertainty, I think the best approach is to try to break down one example step by step and see if I can deduce the pattern from there.

Take for instance:

(5 (2,4) (1x1) 4 [[1]])

So starting with node 5. Then inside parentheses: parameters are 2,4; perhaps this means it has two children or edges? Or maybe it's indicating something else like a dimension size of 2x4.

Then (1x1) could be the dimensions for some matrix associated with this node, and then 4 [[1]] might represent four child nodes each connected via an array [1].

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe "1x1" refers to something like a single edge or connection.

Alternatively, maybe it's representing that node 5 has two children: one is a subtree with parameters (2), and another with (4). Then the next part might be specifying some attributes of node 5 itself.

But again, without knowing what each component stands for, this remains speculative.

Perhaps looking at how these are structured in the output tree will help. For example, if I see something like:

(2 (1,3) ... ) 

Then maybe that means node 2 has two children: one at position 1 and another at position 3? Or perhaps it's an ordered list of child nodes.

Alternatively, each number after the opening parenthesis could be a tuple indicating multiple attributes or properties of that node. For instance, (0, 0) might mean both left and right dimensions are zero, or something along those lines.

I think I need to approach this systematically:

1. Identify all components within each set of parentheses.
2. Try to map each component to a possible meaning based on context.
3. Look for recurring patterns or consistent uses of these components across different parts of the structure.

Starting with the first input example:
(0 (0, 0) (10x8) ... )

Perhaps:

- 0 is the node's identifier.
- (0, 0): Maybe the number of children it has? Or perhaps dimensions like rows and columns. If so, a 10x8 matrix could represent connections or properties in a grid format.
- Then another set of parameters: [[0s]], which might be arrays representing child nodes.

But then looking at the output example:

(2 (1,3) ... )

Maybe this node has two children: one at position 1 and another at position 3. Or perhaps it's an ordered pair indicating a relationship between nodes.

Alternatively, maybe these are layers in the tree structure, with each set of parentheses representing a deeper level of the tree.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck because without knowing what exactly this notation represents, it's hard to map correctly.

Perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe considering that trees can be represented in various ways—like as adjacency lists or matrices—I'll try to see which representation aligns with these components.

Looking at the output example:

(2 (1,3) ... )

Maybe node 2 has two children: nodes 1 and 3.

But then looking back at the input examples, they seem more complex with multiple layers and nested structures. So perhaps this is a tree with multiple levels, where each node can have several child subtrees defined by their own parameters.

If I consider that, maybe each main node (like 0 or 5) has its own set of child nodes specified within the parentheses after it. For instance:

- Node 0 has children defined by (0,0), which might mean two child nodes: one with parameters (10x8) and another with some other dimensions.
- Then each child node further breaks down into their own subtrees.

But again, without knowing how to interpret these components, this is speculative.

Maybe I should consider that the numbers after the opening parenthesis are layers or depths. So starting from the root:

Layer 1: Node 0

Then its children at layer 2:
- (0,0) meaning two child nodes
- [[0s]] indicating arrays of zeros for those children?

But then in Layer 3, we have subtrees like (5 (2,4)...), which could be the children of node 0.

Alternatively, perhaps each main number is a unique identifier, and within its parentheses are details about how it's connected or what properties it has. The arrays [[1s]] might represent connections to child nodes with certain attributes.

But honestly, without more examples or definitions, I'm just guessing here.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to accept that this notation represents a tree where each node can have multiple children defined by these parameters, and the arrays within indicate specific properties of those child nodes. Then, translating this into standard tree structures would involve mapping each node's identifier to its children based on the parameters in parentheses.

In summary, without knowing exactly what each part represents, I'm unable to provide a precise translation. However, if I had more context or examples explaining how these components map to specific tree attributes, I could systematically convert this notation into a standard tree representation.
</think>

To address your request for translating a custom tree structure notation into a standard tree format, it's important to clarify the mapping of each component in the custom notation. Here's a structured approach based on typical tree representations:

1. **Root Node Identification**: The initial number (e.g., 0 or 5) represents the root node of the tree.

2. **Children Specification**:
   - Numbers within parentheses after the root node indicate its immediate children.
     - For example, `0 (0, 0)` suggests that node 0 has two child nodes specified by `(10x8)` and another set indicated elsewhere.

3. **Child Subtrees**: Each child node may have its own subtree defined with additional parameters:
   - Dimensions like `10x8` could represent the size of connections or data within the subtree.
   - Arrays (e.g., `[[1]]`) might denote specific attributes or connections to further children.

4. **Recursive Structure**: The process is recursive, where each child node can have its own set of children defined similarly.

Here's an example translation:

- Custom: `(5 (2,4) (1x1) 4 [[1]])`
  - Root: Node 5
    - Child Nodes:
      - Node A (parameters `(2)` indicating a subtree)
      - Node B (parameters `(4)` indicating another subtree)

This approach assumes each set of parentheses after the root node specifies its children, which in turn can have their own subtrees. The exact mapping would depend on specific definitions provided for the notation.

Without precise mappings for all components, this provides a general framework to interpret and convert such notations into standard tree structures.
