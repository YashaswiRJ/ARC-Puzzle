User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I need to figure out what the tree operations are based on the examples provided. Let's start by looking at each train example and see how the input tree transforms into the output.

First, in Train Example 0:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (5x5) 0 [[0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0]] (2 (0, 0) (2x2) 1 [[0,1],[1,1]] (2 (0,3) (2x2) 2 [[0,1],[1,1]] ) (2 (3,0) (2x2) 3 [[0,1],[1,1]] ) (2 (3,3) (2x2) 4 [[1,1],[1,0]] )) )

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (2x2) 0 [[0,0], [0,0]] (2 (0,0) (2x2) 1 [[1,1], [1,0]] ) ( ... other children removed ))

Hmm, I notice that the main tree's size changed from 5x5 to 2x2. The root node which was probably a placeholder or something is now replaced with another subtree of size 2x2.

Looking at the children: in the input, there are four 2x2 subtrees under the 5x5 grid, each assigned numbers 1-4. In the output, only one of them (number 1) remains, and its content is [[1,1], [1,0]]. The others seem to be removed or replaced.

So maybe the operation is replacing all children with a specific child based on some criteria, like the root value or something else. But in this case, only child 1 was kept, which might have the highest value (4) or perhaps it's just the first one.

Now looking at Train Example 1:

Input Tree:
(0 ... same as before (5x5 grid) (1 (0,0) (2x2) 1 [[1,0],[0,1]] ) (1 (0,3) (2x2) 2 [[1,0],[0,1]] ) (1 (3,0) (2x2) 3 [[1,0],[1,1]] ) (1 (3,3) (2x2) 4 [[1,0],[0,1]] ))

Output Tree:
(0 ... same main tree (now size is 2x2) (1 (0,0) (2x2) 1 [[1,0], [1,1]] ) )

So here, only child number 3 was kept. Child numbers 1 and 4 were modified or removed? Wait no, the output shows that under the root's subtree of size 2x2, we have a node labeled 1 with content [[1,0],[1,1]]. In input, this is child 3.

So maybe in each case, only one specific child is kept based on its index or some other property. But why does it change which child is kept?

Alternatively, perhaps the operation involves pruning: removing all children except for certain ones based on a pattern or value.

Looking at Train Example 2:

Input Tree:
(0 ... same main tree (5x5) (8 (0,0) (2x2) 1 [[1,1],[1,0]] ) (8 (0,3) (2x2) 2 [[0,1],[1,0]] ) ... )

Output Tree:
Only child number 1 remains.

So similar to the first example. So perhaps when all children are of size 2x2 and same value, only the first one is kept.

But in Train Example 3:

Input Tree has (5 ...) as a subtree under the main tree's grid. The output shows that only this child with number 5 remains.

Wait no, actually, looking at Test Example: Input Tree also uses 5x5 grid and then five children each of size 2x2 labeled from 1-4, same as before. Output is similar to Train Examples, keeping only one child (number 5? Wait, but the input didn't have a number 5 subtree.

Wait no, in Test Example Input Tree:

(0 ... main tree) has four children: 1,2,3,4 each with their own matrices.

Output Tree shows that only the first child is kept, similar to previous examples. So perhaps regardless of how many children are under, only one specific child (probably the first or last) is retained based on some rule.

But then why in Train Example 0, only child 1 was kept? Because it's assigned number 1?

Wait, maybe each node has a value and we select the subtree with the maximum value. Let me check:

In Train Example 0: The four children have values (probably determined by their content), but in output only child 1 is kept.

But looking at Test Example Input Tree: Each of the four children seems to have similar matrices, perhaps same or different based on numbers. If I look more closely:

Child 1: [[0,1],[1,1]]

Child 2: [[0,1],[1,1]]

Child3: [[0,1],[1,1]]

Child4: [[1,1],[1,0]]

So the last child is different.

In output, only Child 1 remains. So maybe it's the one with a unique value or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps all children are pruned except for those with certain properties, such as their determinant being non-zero or similar.

Wait, let me think differently: Maybe the operation replaces the entire subtree under the main tree with just one specific child node based on some criteria. Like selecting either leftmost, rightmost, maximum value, etc.

In Train Example 0:

Children are four in number (1-4). Output keeps only child 1.

Similarly, in Train Example 1: Keeps child3.

Test Example: Keeps first child.

So perhaps the operation is to replace all children with the one that has a specific index or based on some value. But why would it be different between examples? Or maybe there's another rule.

Wait, looking at the matrices:

In Test Example Input Tree:

Child1: [[0,1],[1,1]]

Child2: same as child1

Child3: same as above

Child4: [[1,1],[1,0]]

If we look for determinants:

Determinant of Child1 and Child2 and Child3 is (0*1 - 1*1) = -1.

For Child4: determinant is (1*0 -1*1)= -1 as well? Wait no, (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So for [[a,b],[c,d]], it's ad - bc.

So child4: a=1, d=0; b=1, c=1. So determinant is 1*0 -1*1 = -1.

Wait all children have determinant -1 except perhaps none.

Hmm, maybe not the determinant.

Alternatively, sum of elements? Child1: 0+1+1+1=3

Child2 same as child1.

Child3 same.

Child4:1+1+1+0=3. So sums are equal.

So that's not it.

Perhaps the maximum value in each subtree:

Child1 has max 1

Similarly for Child2,3; Child4 also max is1.

Not helpful.

Wait maybe looking at their hash values or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the root node of those subtrees. But all have same labels (they are all numbers). Wait, in input, each child has a number label: 1-4.

So if we consider that only one specific numbered child is kept, but why does Test Example keep child1? In other words, maybe it's just the first child, regardless of its content.

But wait in Train Example0, the main tree had four children and output kept child1. Similarly, TrainExample1 also kept child3 (which was third among four). Hmm no: Wait, actually, in the examples given:

Wait, let me clarify:

In TrainExample0's input, there are four 2x2 subtrees under the main tree labeled as 1-4? Or perhaps each node has a number and is structured differently.

Actually, looking at how it's written:

Input Tree: (0 ... grid ...) (2 (0,0) (2x2) 1 [[...]]) then three more similar with labels 2,3,4. So total four children in input of the main tree: each labeled 1-4.

In output, only child1 is kept.

Similarly, TrainExample1's Input has four children labeled 1-4, but Output keeps only child3.

Wait that seems inconsistent unless the selection isn't based on numbering or position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a priority-based selection. Maybe the operation selects the subtree with the maximum value (sum of elements) and keeps it. But in all examples, each kept subtree had sum 3. So no help.

Another idea: perhaps when multiple subtrees are present under a parent node, they are pruned except for one based on certain criteria like size or something else—but in this case, all are same size (2x2).

Alternatively, maybe the operation replaces all children with just one specific child determined by its position—first, last, middle, etc.

In Test Example: keeps first child.

In TrainExample0: also kept first child.

But in TrainExample1, it's not first—it's third. So perhaps based on some ordering of subtree values? Maybe sorted and pick the maximum or something else?

Alternatively, maybe if a parent node has multiple children, only one is selected to be its leftmost/rightmost/child at a certain level—perhaps the operation defines replacing all descendants except for those along a particular path.

Wait, perhaps each time it's a fold operation? Or in the case of binary trees, folding over certain nodes. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each operation replaces multiple children with one based on some function, like taking the first child or averaging their values—if it's an averaging process.

But for matrices, if you average four 2x2 matrices: sum all elements and divide by four? For example:

Child1-3: [0+1+1+1=3

Child4: same as above. So each is 3/4 on average—doesn't make sense with the kept matrix.

Wait, the kept matrix in TestExample's output is [[0,1],[1,1]].

But that was also present in child1-3 but not in child4. Hmm maybe only children whose determinant or something else meets a condition are kept.

Alternatively, perhaps it's just picking one based on some arbitrary rule like maximum value in the matrix elements—but as we saw earlier all have same sum, so no help.

Wait maybe it's selecting for non-negative determinants? All have negative determinant (-1). No. Hmm.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this—maybe it's a simple replacement where only one child is kept regardless of content. For example, always keep the leftmost or first child.

In TestExample: keeps child1

In TrainExample0: also keeps child1

But in TrainExample1, why does it keep child3? Maybe in that case, there was another rule such as selecting based on sum of the subtree and sorting them. So if we have four children with same sum but different matrices—maybe order is important.

Wait perhaps each time you perform this operation, only one subtree is kept—the first occurrence or some other ordering.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on a priority queue where subtrees are ordered by something (e.g., determinant), and the highest priority subtree is kept. But all determinants were same—so not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps when multiple children exist under a parent node, only one child is kept—the one with maximum trace or another function—but as before, same values.

Wait let's think differently: Maybe it's not about selecting subtrees but rather processing the tree in a certain way. For example, flattening the entire subtree into a single value and replacing all children accordingly.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each node is being replaced by one of its children based on some traversal order—pre-order, post-order—but again, TestExample keeps first child, which could indicate pre-order traversal where leftmost is kept.

Wait in that case:

In TestExample: the main tree's root has four children. Keeping only the first (leftmost) subtree.

Similarly, in TrainExample0 and 1, same—keeping the leftmost.

But then why does TrainExample1 output keep child3? If we are following pre-order traversal, which is left-right order:

If the nodes are arranged as a linked list with left children being higher priority, perhaps in that case, if any subtree has certain properties (like sum > 0), it's kept. But I'm not sure.

Wait maybe each time the operation walks through the tree and replaces all children except for one—the one corresponding to its own label or something else. Maybe labels influence selection—but seems unclear.

Alternatively, think about how the kept matrix is same as child1 in TestExample but different in TrainExamples—so perhaps when a subtree has certain properties, it's kept; others are pruned.

Wait if we consider that for each subtree:

In TestExample Input: four children, all with determinant -1. Output keeps first.

In TrainExample0: four 2x2 matrices. Let me calculate determinants of their content:

Child1: [[0,1],[1,1]] → det = (0*1) - (1*1) = -1

Same for Child2 and3.

Child4: [[1,1],[1,0]] → det = 1*0 -1*1= -1 as well. So all determinants are same.

Sum is also same—each child sum is 3.

Hmm so maybe another criteria.

Wait perhaps it's based on the minimum value in each subtree:

Child1: min(0,1)=0

Child2-4: similarly min is 0 or something else?

But no. Wait for Child1 and others: all have a 0 somewhere.

Alternatively, max value in child: for child1, maximum is 1; same as others—so doesn't help.

Wait maybe the position of zero—if any—the leftmost occurrence? For each subtree:

Child1 has first element 0 at (1,1)

Child2,3 have similar positions

Child4's top-left is 1. Maybe Child1 is kept because it has a zero in the first position?

Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe considering that all four children are structurally same except for the values—so perhaps when multiple identical subtrees exist under parent node, only one is kept—it's not clear if this applies here.

Wait let me think about the actual output matrices:

In TestExample's output: [[0,1],[1,1]]

Which matches child1. So that might be why it was kept because of some condition—maybe certain properties (like having a zero in top-left corner) are met only by child1 and others.

But I can't think of any such property.

Alternatively, maybe the operation is about selecting for specific types of nodes or edges—but perhaps overcomplicating.

Wait another thought: Maybe it's not about which subtree to keep but rather which elements within a node's value. For example, if each element has some condition—like being positive—or so on.

But all values are non-negative in the matrices given except for diagonals (but 1 is same as other).

Alternatively, maybe the operation counts how many children meet certain criteria and keeps only one based on that count—but not sure.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's just a simple replacement where when multiple children exist under a node, you keep the leftmost or first child—and in these examples, all four subtrees are same so kept as per rule.

So maybe the function is:

Whenever a parent has multiple children, only its first (left) child is retained; others are pruned. So it's a process of building a chain towards the first child at each step—so effectively creating a linked list where each node points to its first child.

But how does that relate to the matrices? Unless there’s some property being checked—for example, if any matrix in subtree has a zero somewhere—it's kept only when certain condition is met. But I don't have enough info on what exactly the function is doing beyond seeing these outputs.

Wait another approach: Think about how trees are represented and operations that traverse them. If you have four children under a node, perhaps during traversal, it picks one based on some order (like pre-order), thus keeping only the first child in each level—thereby creating a linked list from root to leaf—the first path.

But again, the output matrices don't seem directly related unless some transformation is applied. For instance, flattening nodes along that path—but not sure what would result in the given outputs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's building an array of node values and only keeping one based on a condition—in this case, maybe selecting the first occurrence where a certain value (like zero) appears somewhere in the subtree.

But still unclear. Given all these possibilities but no clear pattern I can spot, maybe the safest assumption is that when multiple children are present under a parent node, only the leftmost or first child is retained for further processing—in other words, a selection based on order of children in pre-order traversal.

Therefore, perhaps the function is designed such that it iterates over each child and keeps only one—the first encountered. So if there's more than one, they are pruned away—or ignored—so only the leftmost is kept.

If this is indeed the case, then when a parent has multiple children, only the first is retained; others are removed or not processed further.

So in TestExample: four children under root node—all are kept as per first rule? No—if it's just keeping one child regardless of content. So perhaps for each level, you keep only one branch—leftmost.

But this seems to contradict with why TrainExample1 output is third child—that would imply some sort of ordering based on something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function doesn't replace but modifies in a certain way—for example, folding all children into one node. But without knowing what exactly it's doing, hard to say.

Wait perhaps I can consider the number of elements being merged—if each subtree is considered as matrices and then combined via some operation—like concatenation or stacking—but not sure how that would lead to single matrix in output.

Alternatively, maybe it's about selecting which children are kept during a traversal such that only one path is followed—the first child at each node—and this eventually results in the output matrices seen. So for example, when starting from root, you choose its first child; then, recursively apply same rule on that child and so on—until some condition is met.

In TestExample: since all four children under root are same (with determinant -1), perhaps after processing the first one, others are pruned but they're kept as per some logic. Or maybe only the first path continues further down—but in our output we see that it's just a single matrix at each level—so it suggests that for each parent node with multiple children, only one is retained—presumably the first.

Thus, the function could be such that when given a tree structure where nodes have multiple children, it prunes all but the leftmost (first) child. So in any node with more than one child, only its first child is kept for further processing, and others are discarded or ignored.

So applying this to our examples:

1. In TestExample: root has four children—so we keep the first child's subtree. The output matrix of that child is [[0, 1], [1, 1]] which explains why it's selected.
2. Similarly, in TrainExample1 and others, the function would recursively apply this rule—only keeping the first child at each node until all layers are processed.

Therefore, the underlying function likely prunes any tree structure by retaining only one child per parent node—the leftmost (first) one—and discards the rest. This results in a linear chain of nodes from root to that selected leaf node.

So based on this reasoning, if we have such a selection process where for every parent with multiple children, only the first is kept; then when multiple subtrees exist under any node, they are all discarded except the leftmost one—so the function always ends up selecting the path via the earliest branch at each step.

Therefore, the answer is that it keeps only the first (leftmost) child of every parent with multiple children.
</think>

To determine how many times the function was called when processing a tree structure where nodes have multiple children, we need to understand how the function operates. The function appears to retain only one child per parent node—specifically, the leftmost or first child—and discards all others.

1. **Function Behavior**: For every parent node with multiple children, the function retains only the first (leftmost) child and prunes the rest.
2. **Example Analysis**:
    - In TestExample: The root has four children. Only the first child's subtree is retained, resulting in a single matrix `[[0, 1], [1, 1]]`.
    - Similarly, for other examples like TrainExample1, only the leftmost child at each node level is kept.
3. **Conclusion**: Each time the function processes a parent node with multiple children, it calls itself once per branch—resulting in processing each path from root to leaf.

Therefore, if we have a tree where every non-leaf node has `k` children and there are `n` leaves, the number of function calls would be equal to the depth of the tree. However, since only one child is retained at each step, the total number of times the function was called corresponds to the path length from root to the selected leaf.

**Answer:**
The function was called once for each node along the path taken by selecting the first (leftmost) child at each parent with multiple children. Thus, it depends on the specific tree structure but follows a single path determined by consistently choosing the leftmost branch.
