User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've been given this array of numbers and symbols that look like a kind of matrix or grid. It's written in some sort of encoded format with brackets and commas, which makes it a bit confusing at first glance. Let me try to parse through it step by step.

First off, the user provided this:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]]

Then there are these other parts:

(2 (18, 13) (1x1) 23 [[1]] )

And then a bunch more similar sections.

Hmm. It looks like it's structured with different layers or groups of numbers and matrices inside. The first part is an array of three arrays, each containing nine 1s and some 0s. Then there are these other parts that seem to be tuples with numbers in parentheses.

I think the main structure here is probably a matrix where each cell contains another matrix or a single value based on these conditions. Maybe it's a way of representing nested matrices or perhaps some kind of transformation applied to the initial array.

Let me try breaking down the first part:

The outermost brackets have three subarrays, each with nine elements (1s and 0s). So that's like a 3x9 matrix. Then after that, there are more parts in parentheses. Each starts with a number in parentheses, followed by some coordinates or identifiers.

For example: (2 (18, 13) (1x1) 23 [[1]] )

Breaking this down:
- The outermost number is 2.
- Then inside the first set of parentheses: (18, 13). Maybe these are row and column indices?
- Then there's a description: (1x1), which might indicate the size or type of matrix at that position.
- Following that, numbers like 23 [[1]] – perhaps this is an instruction to take element 23 from some list or another structure?

Wait, maybe it's not about coordinates but something else. The notation isn't entirely clear.

Looking further down, there are references to matrices of different sizes: (2 (8, 3) (1x1) 10 [[1]] ), which suggests that perhaps each position in the main matrix has a submatrix or value associated with it.

Maybe this is part of some kind of tree structure where each node can have children matrices? The numbers like 23 and 25 might be identifiers for specific positions or operations within this structure.

Looking at another part: (1 (6, 8) (9x10) 7 [[1, 1, ... ]])

This seems to indicate a submatrix of size 9x10 starting at position (6,8), with value 7 and containing the array [1,1,...].

Putting this together, perhaps the entire structure is a tree where each node can have child matrices or values. The numbers in parentheses might represent the depth or identifier for that particular subtree.

I need to figure out how all these parts connect. Is it a binary tree? Maybe each (number) corresponds to a matrix at a certain level of nesting?

Let me try mapping this out:

1. Start with the main array:
   - It's 3x9, so perhaps the first three lines are nodes in the top layer.

2. Each of these has child matrices or values based on their position.

But without more context, it's hard to know for sure. Maybe each element can branch into submatrices as per some rules defined by the tuples.

Alternatively, maybe this represents a transformation where certain operations are applied at specific positions, indicated by the coordinates (18,13), and the numbers after that represent the result or another matrix.

Another approach is to consider that these could be pointers or indices within an array. For instance, in programming, sometimes arrays can have elements that reference other parts of themselves.

Given that there are several layers with similar structures, it might be a multi-level pointer system where each element points to another submatrix defined by the numbers.

Let me try focusing on one section:

(1 (6, 8) (9x10) 7 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], ... ])

This could mean that at position (6,8), there's a submatrix of size 9x10 with value 7 and containing the provided array.

If I have to reconstruct this, maybe each number in parentheses corresponds to an element in a tree where nodes can be matrices or single values. The first number is the node identifier, followed by its position (row, column), then its type (like size if it's a matrix) and value.

So putting that together:

- Node 23 at position (18,13) has some matrix associated with it.
- Node 25 at another coordinate does something similar.
- Then there are nodes like 7 in the middle layer pointing to submatrices of size 9x10 starting at (6,8).
  
But how do all these numbers fit together? Is this a linked list where each number points to the next node?

Alternatively, maybe it's an adjacency matrix where certain connections are defined by these tuples.

Wait, considering the initial array is three subarrays of nine elements each. So 3x9. Then in another part, there's (2 (8,3) etc.), which could be referring to a position within that structure.

I think I'm getting tangled up here. Maybe it's better to approach this as constructing some kind of data structure step by step based on these rules.

Let me try building a simple version:

Start with the main array: 3 rows, each with 9 elements (1s and 0s). Then, for each element in the first layer, perhaps we have children matrices or values. Each child is defined by the numbers after.

For example, take the first subarray: [1,1,1,...]. At position somewhere (maybe row 18?), there's a matrix of size something with value 23 and containing another array.

But without knowing where these positions are in relation to each other, it's hard to map this out. Maybe all the coordinates refer to global positions within some larger structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers like 18,13; 6,8 are row-column pairs that index into an outer matrix which then points to inner matrices.

I'm stuck because without more context or a clear rule on how these tuples relate to each other and the initial array, it's challenging to reconstruct the structure properly.

Wait, maybe this is part of a specific algorithm or encoding where each tuple represents a transformation or operation applied at that position. For example:

- The first number could be an identifier.
- The next two numbers are row and column indices.
- The following numbers describe the type (like 1x1 matrix) and value.

But I'm not sure how to translate this into a structure without knowing what operations are defined by these tuples.

Perhaps each tuple defines a node in a graph where nodes have positions, types, and values. Then building such a graph would reconstruct the entire data structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's similar to JSON nesting but with specific numbers representing different layers.

This is really challenging because there's too little information about how these elements are connected or what they represent beyond their numerical identifiers.

Maybe I need to consider that each of these tuples is an instruction to create a new matrix or perform some operation at the specified position, using the previous matrices as inputs.

But without knowing the specific operations, it's hard to say. Maybe these numbers correspond to indices in a list where each entry defines how to construct the next part.

Wait, looking again:

The initial array is 3x9 with binary values (1s and 0s). Then there are other parts like (2 (18,13) etc.) which could be identifiers for specific cells or nodes that reference submatrices.

If I consider each of these tuples as pointers to other arrays, then the entire structure becomes a collection of interconnected data points where each point can refer back to others.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to represent sparse matrices where only certain positions have non-zero values (the 1s), and the rest are zero. But that might not explain all the numbers.

Another thought: maybe these tuples represent coordinates in different layers or depths of the matrix. So each tuple defines a position at a certain depth, with corresponding value.

But again, without more context on how to interpret these positions across different depths, it's difficult.

Perhaps I should focus solely on reconstructing part of this structure step by step and see if that gives me any insights.

Looking at one section:

(2 (18, 13) (1x1) 23 [[1]])

Assuming the main matrix is larger than just the initial 3x9 array. So maybe position (18,13) in some global grid refers to a 1x1 matrix with value 23 and containing [1].

But how does that connect back to the initial array? Is there an indexing scheme where all these positions are part of a larger structure?

Wait, perhaps each tuple defines a node in a linked list or tree. The first number is the current node, followed by its child node defined by (row,column), and then some metadata.

But again, without knowing the exact rules for linking, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe these tuples are part of an encoding where numbers correspond to different operations: e.g., 1 represents a 1x1 matrix, 2 could be something else, etc. But this is speculative.

I think I'm stuck because there's insufficient information on how the tuples relate to each other and the initial data structure.

Wait, perhaps these are coordinates in a multi-dimensional array where each tuple defines a point in higher dimensions. So (18,13) could be an index into a 2D array, then followed by another coordinate for subarrays.

But again, this is too vague without knowing how the dimensions expand.

Given that, maybe it's better to consider that each of these tuples represents a node in some graph where nodes have attributes like row, column, type (matrix size), and value. Then constructing such a graph would form the required data structure.

Alternatively, perhaps these numbers are part of an algorithmic step-by-step process where each tuple defines the next operation or matrix to create based on previous ones.

But without knowing what operations correspond to which numbers, it's impossible to say.

In summary, I'm finding it difficult to reconstruct this data structure because there's insufficient information about how these tuples relate to each other and the initial array. Without a clear rule set or additional context, mapping out the entire structure remains elusive.

Perhaps if I try another approach: look for patterns in the numbers given.

Looking at all the numbers mentioned:

Initial subarrays:
- [1,1,1,...] (three 1s)
- [1,0,1,...] (alternating with some zeros)
- [1,1,1,...] again

Then other tuples:
23, 25; in another part: 7.

These numbers could be indices into the initial array or separate lists. Maybe they refer to specific positions within a larger matrix that's built from these elements.

Alternatively, perhaps these are hash values or some form of pointers. But without knowing how they map, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe all these numbers correspond to positions in an adjacency list where each node is identified by these tuples. So the main array could be nodes with connections defined by these tuples.

But again, this is speculative.

Perhaps focusing on one part: (2 (18,13) 1x1 23 [[1]])

If I consider that as position 2 in some list refers to a node at (18,13) which has a value of 23 and contains the array [1]. But how does this connect back?

Wait, perhaps each tuple is an operation: first number defines what to do, then next numbers define parameters. For example:

- Tuple starting with 2 could be "create a 2x2 matrix", but that's just a guess.

But again, without knowing the operations associated with these numbers, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe each tuple is an instruction for moving to another part of the structure. Like in assembly language: move from one place to another based on certain conditions.

In that case, 18 and 13 could be offsets or addresses where processing continues after creating a matrix at position (18,13) with value 23 containing [[1]].

But again, without knowing the memory layout, this is unclear.

Given all these uncertainties, perhaps it's best to conclude that reconstructing the entire data structure from these tuples is not possible without additional context or rules on how they relate to each other and the initial array. Each tuple might represent a part of an interconnected system where nodes are connected based on their coordinates and contain specific values, but without knowing exactly how these connections work, it's impossible to map out.

Alternatively, perhaps this is referencing elements in a graph or tree where each node has properties like row, column, type, value, etc., and the tuples define relationships between them. For example, tuple (2, 18,13) could mean node 2 refers to position (18,13) with some type and value.

But again, without a clear definition of these roles, it's hard to proceed.

Given that, I think my best course is to acknowledge the ambiguity in the problem statement and state that without further information on how these tuples relate to each other or the initial data structure, reconstructing the intended matrix is not feasible.

It appears there isn't enough information provided to accurately reconstruct the intended matrix. The given tuples may represent various nodes or connections within a larger data structure, but without clear rules for interpreting their roles and relationships, it's impossible to build the exact matrix as described.

**Answer:**

The problem lacks sufficient context or rules to interpret how the numbers relate to each other and form the desired matrix. Without additional information on the specific operations or mappings defined by these tuples, reconstructing the intended structure is not feasible.
