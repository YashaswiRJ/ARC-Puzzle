User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, so I've got this input tree structure here that the user provided. It looks a bit complicated with all these numbers and sublists. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, at the top level, there's something starting with (0 (0, 0) ...). Hmm, okay, maybe each of these is a node in a tree? The first part is 0, which might be an identifier or a value for this node. Then there are two children: both are also zeros? Not sure what that means yet.

Looking deeper, I see numbers like 15x15 attached to some parentheses. Maybe that's the size of a matrix or something related to the structure. There are several lists inside with mostly zeros and some ones. It seems like it could be a grid or adjacency matrix.

Then there are these mentions of (5 (1,7) ...), which probably refers to another node in the tree. The numbers 1,7 might represent positions or something related to indices. There's also a mix of different sublists with varying elements—some have multiple ones and zeros arranged differently.

I think I need to figure out if this is some kind of tree structure where each node has children, and these sublists are representing connections or weights between nodes. Maybe it's an adjacency matrix for each level? Or perhaps it's a more complex data structure like a graph or a grid-based tree.

The user mentioned a test example with specific inputs, so maybe I should look at that to get some context. The input starts with (0 (0, 0) ...) and goes on with different numbers. It includes something called "15x15" which might indicate the size of a matrix or grid. Then there are multiple nodes mentioned like 4, 5, 8 with various children.

I'm also noticing that some sublists have ones scattered in them. For example, [0, 0, 1] and others. This could represent connections where 1 indicates a connection and 0 indicates none. Maybe each node has certain connections to its neighbors based on these values.

Another part of the input is (8 (5,5) ... [[1,1,1,1], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,1], [1,1,1,1]]). This looks like a 4x4 matrix with some ones and zeros. Perhaps this represents a specific pattern or adjacency for that node's children.

I'm trying to figure out if there's any repeated structure here. There are multiple nodes with (5 ...) something, each having different sublists. Maybe each of these is representing a different part of the tree or a different layer in some kind of graph.

The user also mentioned 1x1 matrices like [[1]] appearing multiple times. That might be indicating that certain nodes have single connections or are isolated points with a weight of 1.

Looking at the deeper levels, there's (4 (5,4) ...) and sublists like [0, 0, 0, 0, ...] which has some ones scattered in it. Maybe these represent more specific connections or weights between nodes at different levels.

I think I need to visualize this structure somehow. Perhaps drawing a tree where each node branches out into its children with the sublist indicating something about their connections. For example, if a child is [0, 0, 1], maybe that means it's connected only to the third element in its parent's adjacency list.

But without knowing exactly what these numbers represent—whether they are indices, connection weights, or something else—I might be overcomplicating things. Maybe I should focus on the numerical values and how they're structured within each node's parentheses.

Looking at the first part: (0 (0, 0) ... [[...]]) with some zeros inside the lists. It could be that this is a base case where certain nodes don't connect to many others because of all the zeros.

Then there are nodes like (5 (1,7) ...) and so on. Maybe these represent higher-level connections or different types of nodes in the tree. The numbers after 5 might indicate parent nodes or something similar.

I also see references to 3x4 matrices with patterns like [1,1,1,1], [1,0,0,1], etc. This suggests that at a certain level, each node has connections structured in this specific way. Maybe it's part of a grid-based tree where nodes are arranged in rows and columns.

Another thing is the varying sizes: 15x15, 3x4, and so on. This could mean different layers or different sections within the overall structure. Each size might represent how many connections each node has at that particular level.

I think I need to break down each part systematically:

1. Start with the root node, which is (0 (0, 0) ...). Maybe this node doesn't connect to any other nodes because both children are zeros.
2. Then look at its children: another two zero nodes. Perhaps these don't connect further either.
3. Move down to the next set of nodes like (5 (1,7)...). This might indicate a higher-level node with specific connections based on the 1x1 matrices and other sublists attached.
4. Each sublist under these nodes could represent how this node connects to its own children or subsequent nodes.

I'm still not entirely sure what each part signifies numerically, but I can see that it's building up a complex tree structure with various connection patterns at different levels. Maybe the user is working on something related to graph theory, data structures, or network analysis where such detailed node connections are important.

In summary, this input defines a hierarchical tree where each node has its own set of children and specific connection patterns represented by sublists within each node's structure. The numbers likely denote either indices, weights, or presence/absence of connections to other nodes in the tree.

The input provided represents a complex hierarchical tree structure with multiple levels, where each node can have children defined by sublists containing numerical values (0s and 1s). These values likely indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific connections or relationships between nodes at different levels. The structure appears to be part of a graph or network analysis, possibly in fields such as data structures, graph theory, or network science.

To summarize:

- **Root Node**: The top-level node is defined as 0 with two children, both being 0.
- **Subsequent Levels**: Nodes are defined recursively, each containing their own children specified by sublists. For example, a node (5 (1,7) ...) has its own set of children based on the sublist [[1], [1,1,1]] and other nested structures.

This structure could represent an adjacency list where 1 indicates a direct connection to another node at the next level, while 0 indicates no connection. The varying sizes of sublists (e.g., 3x4 matrices) suggest different levels of depth or complexity within the tree.

To fully interpret this input, one would need to know the exact meaning of each numerical value and how they map to connections or relationships between nodes in the context of the specific application or problem being addressed.
