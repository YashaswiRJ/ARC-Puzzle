User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem. It looks like there's a lot of nested parentheses and lists involved. Let me see if I can parse this correctly.

Starting with the first part: it says (5 (0,0) (10x10) [[...]])). Hmm, maybe that's indicating some kind of structure where 5 is connected to (0,0) in a 10x10 grid. Then there are several other lists following, like [0, 0, 0, ...] ten times, which probably represent rows or something similar.

Then I see another part: (2 (4,5) (2x1) [[1], [1]]). So this is some kind of smaller structure within the first one. Maybe it's connected to nodes 4 and 5 in a 2x1 grid with two lists each containing a single element.

Next up: (3 (7,9) (3x1) [[1], [1], [1]]). So another sub-structure here for nodes 7 and 9 in a 3x1 grid. This has three lists with one element each.

The input example seems to be similar but structured differently, starting with (0 (0,0) ...) followed by other sections like (5 ...), then some more numbers and brackets.

I think I need to break this down step by step, maybe looking at the numbers first. The initial structure is 10x10 for the first part, which could mean a grid of 10 rows and 10 columns. Then there are multiple lists that might represent connections or data points within this grid.

The second example starts with (0 (0,0) ...) followed by other sections like 5 connected to (4,5). So perhaps each number represents a different component or layer in the structure.

I'm getting confused about how all these numbers and brackets relate. Maybe I should try drawing it out or looking for patterns. The lists inside seem to have repeating elements, especially zeros and ones, which might indicate some kind of binary data or connections between nodes.

Wait, maybe each number at the beginning is a node identifier, and the parentheses group them with their coordinates and grid size. For example, (5 (0,0) 10x10) could mean node 5 is connected to position (0,0) in a 10x10 grid.

The lists inside might be adjacency lists or connections from each node. The [[0,...], [0,...]] etc., are probably rows of data associated with that grid.

I'm still not sure how all these pieces fit together into the overall structure. Maybe I should focus on one part at a time and see if I can reconstruct it.

Looking back, perhaps the numbers like 5, 2, 3 correspond to different sections or components within the main structure. The 10x10 grid is larger, while others are smaller grids like 2x1 and 3x1.

I think the key here is to parse each part systematically: identify the number as a node identifier, then its coordinates in a certain grid size, followed by lists that probably represent connections or properties of that node within that grid.

But I'm still not entirely clear. Maybe if I try translating this into code using something like Python's nested lists and dictionaries, it could help me visualize it better.

Wait, perhaps each number is an identifier for a layer in a graph structure where each layer has nodes with connections defined by their adjacent cells in the grid.

I need to figure out how these grids interact. Are they connected through edges based on their positions? Or do they represent separate components within the same overall structure?

The fact that there are multiple 10x10, 2x1, and 3x1 grids suggests a hierarchical or multi-layered graph where nodes from smaller grids might be connected to those in larger ones.

I'm getting closer, but I think without more context on what exactly this representation is meant to model (like a neural network, state machine, etc.), it's hard to pin down the exact structure. However, based on the numbers and grid sizes, I can at least parse them into their components.

Maybe each main number represents a node in a graph where edges are determined by being adjacent in the grids. So nodes 0,5,2,3 would be connected if they share an edge or have some kind of relationship defined by their positions in overlapping grids.

But without knowing how these grids are placed relative to each other, it's tough to say for sure. Perhaps node 5 is positioned at (0,0) in a larger grid and overlaps with smaller grids containing nodes 2 and 3?

I'm not entirely confident about this approach. I might need to look up similar structures or examples of how such nested parentheses are typically interpreted.

Alternatively, maybe each number's position within its own grid defines connections to other numbers across different grids. For instance, node 5 in a 10x10 grid could connect to nodes 2 and 3 in their respective smaller grids if they align at certain positions.

Overall, I think the solution involves breaking down each section into its components: identifying the node identifiers, their grid sizes, and then mapping out the connections based on adjacency or overlapping positions. But without more specific rules about how these connect, it's challenging to construct the full structure accurately.

To solve this problem, we need to parse a complex nested structure represented by parentheses and lists. The goal is to interpret each component systematically.

   - Each main number represents a node identifier followed by its coordinates in a grid size (e.g., 5 (0,0) 10x10 means node 5 at position (0,0) in a 10x10 grid).
   - Following each node, there are lists that likely represent connections or properties within the grid.

2. **Parse Grids:**
   - The first part is a 10x10 grid with nodes and their data points.
   - Subsequent parts include smaller grids (e.g., 2x1 and 3x1) with fewer elements, which are connected to specific coordinates within larger grids.

3. **Reconstruct Structure:**
   - Each node's position in its grid is key for understanding connections to other nodes.
   - Nodes from smaller grids may be positioned at specific points within larger grids, indicating their relationships.

### Final Answer:

The structure represents a hierarchical graph with multiple layers and grids:
- Node 5 is connected to coordinates (0,0) in a 10x10 grid.
- Nodes 2 and 3 are connected through smaller grids (2x1 and 3x1), positioned at specific points within their respective larger grids.

The final interpretation confirms the hierarchical nature of the connections based on grid positions.
