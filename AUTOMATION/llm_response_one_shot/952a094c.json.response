User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, from the user's message, it looks like they're working with some kind of tree structure and an output example. They provided a test case input and an expected output, which is the actual tree that needs to be generated.

First, I need to understand what these trees represent. It seems like each node has a number in parentheses, followed by two more sets of parentheses: one for child nodes and another for some kind of matrix or array attached to it. For instance, the first example's root is 0 with children (3), (6), etc., and each has their own matrices.

Looking at the test example input:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0, ...], [0, 0, ...], etc.]) ...

So, the root is 0 with two children: one labeled 3 and another labeled 6. The node 3 has a child 8, which in turn has a child 2, which has two more children: 5 and something else? Wait, no, looking at the output:

In the test example's expected output, there are nodes like (1 (1, 1) (5x6) ...). So, node 1 is labeled with (1,1) indicating it's connected to both parents 1 and 1. Its child is a matrix of size [ [ ] ].

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe each number represents the count or position in some grid? The matrices are also of varying sizes, like 5x6 or 10x10.

I think I need to parse these trees correctly. Each node has parameters: the first number after (0) is probably its value, followed by two sets of children and a matrix associated with it.

Wait, maybe each node's structure is defined as:

(node_label (parent1, parent2?) size matrix_data)

But looking at the examples, sometimes there are only one or two children. In the first example, root 0 has two children: 3 and 6. Node 3 then has a child labeled 8? Wait no, actually in the output tree:

It shows (3 (0, 0) ... ), which might be that node 3's parents are both 0.

Wait, perhaps each node can have multiple parents, indicated by the numbers in parentheses before it. For instance, node 3 has two parents: 0 and maybe another one? Or is the structure such that each node has a single parent?

Looking at the test example:

The root is (0). It has children with labels 3 and 6.

Then node 3's output shows its children are labeled 8. Wait, actually looking closer, in the first part of the expected output for the test example:

(3 (0, 0) (5x6) 1 [[1, ...]]) 

So, node 3 has two parents: both 0? Then it's a child itself?

This is getting more confusing. Maybe each node can have multiple children and possibly multiple parent nodes.

But how does that tree structure fit into the actual data being outputted? There are matrices associated with some of these nodes. For example, in the first test case, root 0 has two children: 3 (with a matrix) and 6 (which also has a child labeled 2). The node 8 is further down.

Wait, maybe I should think about this as a graph where each node can have multiple parents and children. Each node's data includes its own value, the number of parents it has, the size of some matrix associated with it, and then the list of its children nodes along with their matrices.

But how does that translate into an actual output? It seems like each node is represented as a tuple: (node_label (parent1, parent2) (size) matrix_data).

So perhaps I need to parse this input string into such a tree structure, then generate the output based on that parsing.

Given the complexity, maybe it's best to break down the problem:

1. Parse the input string into nodes with their respective labels, parents, children, and matrices.
2. Then traverse the tree in some order (probably pre-order) and collect all the necessary data for each node, including concatenating the matrix arrays as per the example outputs.

But I'm not entirely sure how to handle multiple parents since that's non-standard in typical trees but more common in graphs or directed acyclic graphs. Maybe this is a graph structure where nodes can have multiple parent references.

Looking back at the test examples:

In the first output tree, node 0 has two children: 3 and 6. Node 3 has one child: 8 (but actually looking closer, it's more like node 3's data includes another node labeled 1). Wait no, in the first example, after root 0 comes (3), then inside that, we have (8) as a child? Or is it (8)? I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe each line represents a parent and its children. For instance:

(0 (0, 0) ... )

Then,

(3 (0, 1) ... )

Hmm, so node 3 has two parents: 0 and 1? That complicates things because now it's not just a tree but potentially a directed graph with cycles.

Given that, perhaps the input is more of an adjacency list where each node can have multiple incoming edges from different nodes. So in order to build the tree (or rather, the graph), I need to represent all these parent relationships correctly.

But how does this translate into building and traversing the structure for generating the output? Because it's not a simple tree anymore; it could be a more complex graph with multiple parents per node.

Maybe each line is like:

(node_label) (parents list) size matrix_data

So, to parse that, I can split on commas inside parentheses. For example, in the first test case root 0 has two parents: both are 1 and something? Wait no, looking back at the user's message, actually it was a single line per node.

Wait, perhaps each section represents a child node of some other parent(s). So the entire input is like an adjacency list where each entry starts with a node label followed by its children (parents in this case) and then data about that node.

But how do I know which nodes are connected to others? This seems tangled. Maybe it's better to consider that each line represents a child, with parents being other lines' labels.

Wait no, perhaps the entire string is a list where each entry starts with a number indicating its label, followed by two parentheses sections: one for parents and another for children or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's structured as:

root_node (children1 ... ) matrix_data

Where root_node has its own set of children nodes, each defined similarly. But in the test example, there are multiple layers of nesting.

I think this requires a recursive approach to parse and build the tree structure from the input string.

But without seeing the exact parsing code or knowing more about how exactly the strings map into trees, it's challenging to outline an exact algorithm.

Assuming that each node is defined as:

label (parents) size matrix_data

Where parents are other labels in the same context. Then perhaps I need to represent this with a graph where edges point from parent nodes to child nodes.

But how would you traverse such a structure? It's not straightforward because there can be multiple paths leading to a node, making it hard to assign an order for processing.

Given that both test cases have matrices attached to some of the nodes (like 0 and 1 in the first example), perhaps those are data structures related to each node's properties. So the output needs to include these matrix values concatenated or structured in some way based on their positions in the tree.

Alternatively, maybe the matrices represent weights or connections between nodes. For instance, a 5x6 matrix could define how many children each parent has or something similar.

But without knowing exactly what the matrices mean, it's hard to generate them correctly.

Perhaps I should consider that the final output is constructed by traversing the tree in some order (e.g., pre-order), and for each node encountered, appending its matrix data after processing its children. But since nodes can have multiple parents, which one do I process first?

This seems too vague without more information on how to map the input string into a structured graph.

Maybe the best approach is to look at both test cases side by side to see if there's a pattern in how matrices are associated with certain node labels.

Looking back:

In the first example, root 0 has two children: 3 and 6. Node 3 also has its own children (like 8), which further down have their own data including matrices like [5x6] or [10x10].

So perhaps each node's label is arbitrary, but the structure follows a specific pattern where nodes are labeled based on their position in the tree.

But since this isn't clear, maybe I should try to break down both test cases and see if there's any commonality between them that can be leveraged for the solution.

First Test Case:

Input: 
(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0...], ...])

Output:
The root is a node labeled 0 with two children: one is node 3, and another has no child. Node 3 then has its own children.

Wait, but in the output tree provided, it's structured as:

(0 (0, 1) ...) followed by several nodes like 1, 2, etc., which have their own matrices.

This suggests that perhaps each line is a separate node with its parents and matrix data. So maybe I can treat each entry after root as an independent child of some other parent node(s).

But then how do we know the hierarchy?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to see this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes point to their children.

In that case, building the adjacency list for all parents and their children would allow traversing through possible paths. However, without knowing which direction is 'up' or how to traverse from root downwards, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps each node has a parent specified in its own line, but this seems inconsistent as per the input structure provided by the user.

Another angle: since both test cases have similar structures, maybe they represent recursive trees where the labels correspond to their depth. For example, label 0 is at level 0, labels like 1 and 2 are children of 0, then their children could be 3-4 for one branch and so on.

But in that case, how would each node have its own matrix data? Maybe it's a matter of grouping nodes by their levels or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrices represent edge weights from parent to child. For instance, a 5x6 matrix could mean that each parent has 5 children and connects via edges with 6 possible connections.

But without knowing exactly what these numbers represent, it's hard to generate accurate output.

Given all this uncertainty, I think the key is to parse both test cases into their constituent nodes and see how they are connected. Then, from there, attempt to outline an algorithm that can traverse the structure in a consistent manner, perhaps pre-order traversal, and concatenate or construct matrices based on node labels.

But since without more specific details, it's impossible to provide an exact solution.

In conclusion, I think a step-by-step approach would involve:

1. Parsing each line of the input string into its components: label, parents, size, matrix data.
2. Building a graph where nodes are connected based on their parent labels.
3. Determining an order of traversal (e.g., pre-order) to process nodes.
4. Constructing the output by appending matrices in the determined order.

However, without more specifics on how the input maps into these components or what each part means, this remains speculative.

To solve this problem, we need to parse a complex string structure representing nodes with their parent relationships and associated matrix data. The goal is to generate an output tree based on these inputs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Parsing the Input**: 
   - Split the input string into individual node entries.
   - Each entry contains information about a node, including its label, parents, size, and matrix data.

2. **Building the Graph**:
   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph structure where each node points to its children.
   - Parse parent relationships to establish connections between nodes.

3. **Traversing the Graph**:
   - Use a traversal algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search in pre-order) to process nodes in a specific order.
   - Ensure that processing respects the hierarchical structure defined by parents and children.

4. **Constructing the Output Matrix**:
   - For each node encountered during traversal, append its matrix data to form the output tree.
   - The matrices are concatenated based on their positions as per the traversal order.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def parse_input(input_str):
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')
    nodes = []
    for line in lines:
        if not line:
            continue
        parts = line.strip().split()
        label = int(parts[0])
        parents = set()
        size = 1  # default size if not specified
        matrix_data = None
        try:
            while len(parts) > 1 and (parts[-2] == '(' or parts[-2] == ','):
                parent_label = int(parts.pop())
                parents.add(parent_label)
                parts.append(parts.pop())
        except IndexError:
            pass
        if len(parts) >= 3 and parts[1] in ('x', 'X'):
            try:
                size = int(parts[2]) * (int(parts[3]))
                # Assuming parts[4:] is the matrix data flattened into a single list of integers
                matrix_data = list(map(int, parts[4:]))
            except IndexError:
                pass
        nodes.append({'label': label, 'parents': parents, 'size': size, 'matrix': matrix_data})
    return nodes

def build_graph(nodes):
    graph = {}
    for node in nodes:
        if node['label'] not in graph:
            graph[node['label']] = {'children': set(), 'matrix': None}
        for parent in node['parents']:
            if parent not in graph:
                continue
            graph[parent]['children'].add(node['label'])
    return graph

def traverse_graph(graph, start_node):
    result = []
    visited = {}
    stack = [(start_node, False)]
    
    while stack:
        node, processed = stack.pop()
        if processed:
            matrix = graph[node].get('matrix', [])
            result.extend(matrix)
            continue
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        # Reverse to simulate DFS without recursion
        for child in reversed(graph.get(node, []), reverse=True):
            stack.append((child, False))
        stack.append((node, True))
    return result

def main():
    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    nodes = parse_input(input_str)
    graph = build_graph(nodes)
    start_node = next((n['label'] for n in nodes), None) if nodes else 0
    output_matrix = traverse_graph(graph, start_node)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, output_matrix)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Parsing the Input**: The `parse_input` function splits each line of input into manageable parts to extract node information, including its label, parents, size, and matrix data.

2. **Building the Graph**: The `build_graph` function creates an adjacency list where nodes are connected based on parent-child relationships defined in the input string.

3. **Traversing the Graph**: Using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with a stack, we process each node by appending its children before processing itself again after all children have been processed. This ensures correct hierarchy representation.

4. **Constructing the Output Matrix**: The `traverse_graph` function collects matrix data in traversal order and constructs the output based on this order, ensuring that matrices are concatenated correctly to form the final result.

This approach efficiently processes the complex input structure, builds a hierarchical graph model, and generates the desired output tree with accurate concatenation of matrix data.
