User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem here with a lot of numbers and structures. It looks like some kind of tree or matrix operations based on the way it's written. Let me try to parse through it step by step.

First, there are these entries in brackets that seem to represent nodes in a tree. Each node has parameters inside parentheses, and then another set of brackets with more numbers or arrays. It might help if I break down each part individually.

Looking at the test example input, it starts with (0 (0, 0) (15x15) 0 [[...]]). Hmm, so this is a node with value 0, and its children are defined by the next parts. The numbers in parentheses after each node seem to indicate some kind of structure or operation.

Wait, there's also something about matrices here. The first part has (1x1), then later it switches to (2x2). Maybe these represent matrix dimensions? So, each node could be a cell in a larger matrix that gets built up based on its children?

Let me look at the numbers inside the [[...]] brackets. They have arrays with multiple zeros and ones. It seems like they're either matrices filled with zeros or some kind of identity-like structure with ones.

For example, I see [[0, 0], [0, 0]], which is a 2x2 matrix of zeros, and then sometimes [[1, 1], [1, 1]] which has ones in all positions. So maybe each node's value contributes to building up these matrices based on the nodes' structure.

Looking further down, there are multiple entries like (5 (1, 9) (2x2) 6 [[1, 1], [1, 1]]) and so on. The numbers before the parentheses might represent weights or multipliers for each child node's contribution to the parent matrix.

So perhaps this is a way of constructing larger matrices by combining smaller ones with certain weights. Each leaf node (the ones with just zeros) contributes its value multiplied by some weight to the parent nodes, which in turn contribute to higher-level matrices.

Wait, but I'm not sure how exactly these are being combined. Maybe it's additive? Or is there a specific operation involved?

Also, at one point, there's a node with (1x1) and [[0]], another with (4,8) and (2x2), then 8 again with the same structure. It might be that certain nodes are being duplicated or combined in specific ways based on their position.

I'm getting confused about how to interpret these numbers. Maybe I should look for patterns in the weights and matrix dimensions. For instance, a node with weight 5 (like 5 (2,3) ...) is followed by several child nodes each contributing smaller matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps this represents some kind of graph where each node has children based on certain rules, and these matrices are part of defining connections between nodes.

I think I need to figure out if there's a specific operation or rule that transforms the input numbers into the output matrices. Maybe it's about accumulating values from child nodes to form parent matrices.

But honestly, without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what this is doing. It might help to see an example of how smaller inputs are transformed into outputs and reverse engineer the process.

Wait a second, maybe each number in the inner arrays represents an entry in the matrix being constructed. So for a 15x15 matrix, all those zeros would make it a zero matrix, while ones could form identity matrices or other specific patterns.

If I think about how matrices are built from smaller submatrices, perhaps each node's value is contributing to a part of the larger matrix based on its position. The numbers before (like 0,5) might determine which parts get updated with certain values.

But this is all very abstract without knowing the exact rules or operations intended here. I wish there were more details on how these nodes interact or what each number signifies in terms of their contribution to the matrices.

Maybe if I try a simple example: take one node and see how it would expand into its child nodes based on the given structure. If I can figure that out, perhaps I can apply the same logic to larger trees.

For instance, starting with (0 (0,0) 15x15 0 [[...]]). The parent is a zero matrix of size 15x15, and its value is determined by combining zeros from child nodes. But then there are multiple children: each has their own weights and structures.

Perhaps the zeros in the inner arrays represent contributions that sum up to produce the final matrix at the root node. So if I can determine how all these smaller matrices combine with the given weights, I can figure out what the overall matrix looks like.

But again, without knowing exactly which operations are being performed (like addition, multiplication, etc.), it's challenging to map this structure correctly.

I think I need to approach this systematically. Maybe list each node and its children, then see how their contributions add up or interact based on some hidden rule.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a programming aspect here where these nodes represent elements in an array that are being manipulated by certain functions, like filling matrices with specific patterns based on the nodes' values.

In any case, I'm not entirely sure what the exact process is, but breaking it down into individual components and looking for patterns might shed some light. Maybe focusing on smaller subtrees first could help understand how they contribute to larger structures.

The problem involves constructing a matrix from given nodes with specific weights and submatrices. Each node contributes its value multiplied by a weight to the parent nodes, which in turn combine these contributions based on their structure. The matrices are built using zeros and ones, following certain rules for combination.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Nodes and Their Contributions:**
   - Each node is defined by parameters such as its value, position (weight), matrix dimensions, and child nodes.
   - For example, a node with weight 5 contributes five times the values of its child matrices to its parent.

2. **Matrix Dimensions and Structure:**
   - Matrices are built based on their dimensions (e.g., 1x1, 2x2).
   - Zeros fill default or identity-like structures as per the child nodes' contributions.

3. **Combining Child Matrices into Parent Nodes:**
   - Each parent node aggregates values from its children using specified operations.
   - The exact operation depends on whether it's additive, multiplicative, or another defined method.

4. **Constructing Larger Matrices:**
   - Smaller matrices are combined according to their weights and dimensions to form larger matrices at higher levels of the tree.
   - For instance, 2x2 submatrices might be combined in a specific way to form parts of a 15x15 matrix.

5. **Accumulating Contributions:**
   - The final matrix is an accumulation of contributions from all child nodes, scaled by their respective weights and following the defined combination rules.

6. **Final Matrix Formation:**
   - Summing up all contributions results in the final form of the larger matrix at the root node.

**Example Calculation:**

Considering a simple case where each node contributes to its parent:

- Node A (weight 5) has child matrices:
  - Child 1: [[0]]
  - Child 2: [[1,1],[1,1]]
  
- Parent Matrix = (5 * Child 1) + (5 * Child 2)
  = 5*[[0]] + 5*[[1,1],[1,1]]
  = [[0,0],[0,0]] + [[5,5],[5,5]]
  = [[5,5],[5,5]]

Thus, the parent matrix becomes a 2x2 matrix with all elements as 5.

**Note:** The exact operations and rules for combining matrices need to be clearly defined based on the specific problem context.
