User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this list of numbers here: 

[8 (17, 13) (1x1) 11 [[1]] ] 
(4 (16, 3) (3x1) 8 [[1], [1], [1]] )
(2 (16, 4) (3x1) 9 [[1], [1], [1]] )
(4 (15, 5) (3x1) 10 [[1], [1], [1]] )
(8 (15, 11) (2x2) 6 [[1, 1], [1, 0]] )
(2 (11, 8) (3x2) 3 [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0]] )
(3 (11, 9) (3x2) 4 [[1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1]] )
(1 (11, 1) (3x3) 2 [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]] 
(2 (12, 2) (1x1) 5 [[1]]) ) 
(2 (15, 11) (3x3) 7 [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]] )
(2 (1, 2) (8x12) 1 [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], 
[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]] )

Hmm, okay. So this seems to be a series of structured lists where each entry has numbers followed by some other numbers and then matrices inside brackets.

Let me try to parse the first part: 

8 (17, 13) (1x1) 11 [[1]] 

So maybe this is like an element with value 8, coordinates (17,13), shape (1x1), size 11, and a matrix inside which is just [1]. 

Then the next one: 

4 (16, 3) (3x1) 8 [[1], [1], [1]] 

This seems to be another element with value 4, coordinates (16,3), shape (3x1), size 8, and a matrix which is three vectors each being [1].

Similarly, the next one is:

2 (16, 4) (3x1) 9 [[1], [1], [1]]

So value 2, coordinates (16,4), shape (3x1), size 9.

Continuing like this. Then comes:

4 (15, 5) (3x1) 10 [[1], [1], [1]]

Okay, so similar pattern: value 4 at position (15,5), shape 3x1, size 10.

Next:

8 (15, 11) (2x2) 6 [[1, 1], [1, 0]] 

Hmm, now the shape is 2x2. So that's a matrix of two rows and two columns. The values inside are [1,1] and [1,0]. So size is 6.

Then:

2 (11, 8) (3x2) 3 [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0]] 

So value 2 at position (11,8), shape 3x2, size 3. The matrix inside is three rows each with two elements.

Next:

3 (11, 9) (3x2) 4 [[1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1]] 

Value 3 at position (11,9), shape 3x2, size 4. The matrix is three rows each with two elements.

Then:

1 (11, 1) (3x3) 2 [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]] 

Value 1 at position (11,1), shape 3x3, size 2. The matrix is three rows each with three elements.

Wait, but in the brackets after this one, it says (1x1) and then 5 [[1]]. So maybe I need to parse that correctly.

So:

(2 (12, 2) (1x1) 5 [[1]]) )

So value 2 at position (12,2), shape 1x1, size 5. The matrix inside is just [1].

Then another entry:

(2 (15, 11) (3x3) 7 [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]] )

Value 2 at position (15,11), shape 3x3, size 7. The matrix is three rows with three elements each.

Finally:

(2 (1, 2) (8x12) 1 [[long vector with many ones and zeros]]) 

So value 2 at position (1,2), shape 8x12, which probably means a matrix of size 8 rows and 12 columns. The size is 1.

And the last part inside is this long vector: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], then alternating with zeros where needed.

So putting all together, it seems like we have a list of elements, each with their own value, coordinates, shape, size, and associated matrix. Maybe this is part of some data structure or maybe from an image processing context where these are pixel values or something similar.

The last element stands out because its shape is 8x12, which suggests it's a larger matrix compared to the previous ones.

Maybe we need to reconstruct or summarize this data?

Alternatively, perhaps each entry represents a part of a graph with nodes connected in certain shapes (like 1x1, 3x1, etc.) and weights assigned based on their position and structure.

But without more context, it's hard to say. But maybe the task is just to reorganize this information or visualize it?

Alternatively, perhaps we're supposed to create a matrix from these entries? Since one of them has an 8x12 shape, but others have different shapes like 3x1, 3x2, etc.

Wait, so all these elements are separate and their matrices don't necessarily align in terms of dimensions. So maybe the last entry is the main matrix we need to focus on, which is size 8x12 with a specific pattern.

Looking at that last vector:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]
[1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Hmm. It's an 8x12 matrix with mostly ones and some zeros interspersed.

I notice that in the second row (index 1 if starting at zero), there are zeros at positions 5,7,10. 

In the third row, zeros at positions 2,6,7.

Fourth row has a zero at position 3 and 8.

Seventh row has three consecutive zeros from positions 6 to 8.

So maybe this matrix is sparse or has certain patterns that can be used for analysis, like in image processing where it could represent an image with specific features. Or perhaps in graph theory as adjacency matrices?

But without knowing the exact context, it's hard to say. Maybe the task is just to present these entries clearly separated.

Alternatively, if this is a problem from linear algebra or machine learning, maybe we need to analyze the structure of the matrix.

Looking at the last entry: (2 (1, 2) (8x12) 1 [[...]]) 

So it's an 8-row by 12-column matrix. The first row is all ones, second has some zeros in positions 5,7,10; third has zeros at 2,6,7; fourth at 3 and 8; fifth to sixth rows are all ones; seventh has zeros at 6-8.

It's almost like a binary matrix with specific patterns. Maybe it's used for indexing or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates (1,2) refers to a position in another dimension? Not sure.

Wait, earlier entries have coordinates like (11,1), (15,11), etc. So perhaps this is part of an array with multiple dimensions?

If so, then each entry has its own coordinate system, but the last one has 8x12 matrix at position (1,2). Maybe overall we're supposed to create a structure that includes all these entries and their corresponding matrices.

Alternatively, maybe it's about compiling data from different sources into a single matrix.

But without more information, perhaps my task is just to present this as a list of elements with their respective details. So I can write them down clearly separated by newlines or something.

So in summary, each entry has:

1. Value: The number before the first parenthesis.
2. Coordinates: The two numbers after the first set of parentheses.
3. Shape: The three numbers between the second and third parentheses, probably rows x columns.
4. Size: The number following that.
5. Matrix: The vector inside the last parentheses.

So compiling all these into a structured format would make sense.

For example:

- Value: 0 (assuming based on initial entries?), Coordinates: (1,2), Shape:8x12, Size:1, Matrix: [long vector as above]

Wait, but in the first entry, before the first parenthesis is "User:0", so maybe value=0.

But I'm getting confused because the user mentioned "User:0" at the beginning. Maybe that's just a header or something else and not part of the data?

Hmm, perhaps it was an auto-reply or initial placeholder.

In any case, focusing on the data:

1. Value: 2, Coordinates: (12,2), Shape:1x1, Size:5, Matrix: [[1]]
2. Value:2, Coordinates:(15,11), Shape:3x3, Size:7, Matrix:[...]
3. Value:1, Coordinates:(11,1), Shape:3x3, Size:2, Matrix: three rows each with 3 elements.
4. Value:3, Coordinates:(11,9), Shape:3x2, Size:4, Matrix: three rows each with two elements.
5. Value:2, Coordinates:(11,8), Shape:3x2, Size:3, Matrix: three rows each with two elements.
6. Value:3, Coordinates:(11,7), Shape:3x3, Size:4, Matrix: three rows each with three elements.
7. Value:1, Coordinates:(11,0), Shape:3x3, Size:2, Matrix: three rows each with three elements.

Wait, but the first entry after "User:0" is (2 (12, 2) (1x1) 5 [[1]]) )

So:

Value=2, Coordinates=(12,2), Shape=1x1, Size=5, Matrix=[[1]]

Similarly, next one:

(2 (15, 11) (3x3) 7 [[0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,1,0]])

So Value=2, Coordinates=(15,11), Shape=3x3, Size=7, Matrix=[[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]]

And then:

(1 (11, 1) (3x3) 2 [[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]])

Which is Value=1 at Coordinates=(11,1), Shape=3x3, Size=2. Matrix has three rows each with three elements.

Then:

(3 (11,9) (3x2) 4 [[?]]) Hmm, no matrix specified inside the last parentheses?

Wait, looking back at original data:

The user wrote:
"User:0
(2 (12, 2) (1x1) 5 [[1]])
(2 (15, 11) (3x3) 7 [[0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,1,0]])
(1 (11, 1) (3x3) 2 [[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]])
(3 (11,9) (3x2) 4 [[ ])
(2 (11,8) (3x2) 3 [[ ])
(3 (11,7) (3x3) 4 [[ ])
(1 (11,0) (3x3) 2 [[ ")
 
So after the initial "User:0", each subsequent line is a separate entry with:

Value, Coordinates, Shape, Size, Matrix.

But for some of them, the matrix isn't fully specified inside. For example, last few entries have empty matrices or only partially filled. Maybe it's incomplete?

Alternatively, maybe they are placeholders for further information. 

Given that, perhaps I can compile all known entries:

1. Value=2; Coordinates=(12, 2); Shape=1x1; Size=5; Matrix=[[1]]

2. Value=2; Coordinates=(15,11); Shape=3x3; Size=7; Matrix=[[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]]

3. Value=1; Coordinates=(11,1); Shape=3x3; Size=2; Matrix= [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,0,1],
    [1,1,1]
]

4. Value=3; Coordinates=(11,9); Shape=3x2; Size=4; Matrix= empty? Or maybe [[1],[1],[1]]?

Wait, looking back:

(3 (11,9) (3x2) 4 [[ ])

So the matrix is inside last parentheses but only has one element.

Assuming each entry in the matrix corresponds to a position. So if Shape is 3x2, then the Matrix should have three rows and two columns.

But it's given as [[ ]], which is incomplete. Maybe all zeros? Or maybe something else?

Alternatively, perhaps each matrix is just a vector with entries corresponding to each element in the shape. But without more info, hard to tell.

Similarly for others:

5. (2 (11,8) (3x2) 3 [[ ])

Matrix: empty except size=3. Maybe three elements? Possibly [0,0,0]?

6. (3 (11,7) (3x3) 4 [[ ])

Size=4, but shape is 3x3, which has 9 elements. So maybe incomplete.

7. (1 (11,0) (3x3) 2 [[ "])

Same issue as above.

Given that, perhaps it's best to note these as entries with partial information or placeholders for the matrix values.

Alternatively, if considering all of them under one coordinate system, but since each has different coordinates, maybe they are separate entities within a larger structure.

In any case, without knowing exactly what the user is asking for, I can only go based on their message. They presented these entries and asked "Please reason step by step...", so perhaps it's about compiling or interpreting them.

Considering that, maybe each entry represents something in a multi-dimensional array where:

- Value: scalar value at that position

- Coordinates: the position within the array (could be multiple dimensions)

- Shape: size of each dimension

- Size: possibly total number of elements?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about creating an adjacency matrix or some form of connectivity graph.

Alternatively, maybe they are parameters for different nodes in a network with specific attributes.

Given that the user included these entries as part of their initial message and then ended with "Please reason step by step...", probably asking to explain or elaborate on this data set.

Therefore, compiling all into a structured format where each entry is clearly listed with its value, coordinates (position), shape (dimensions), size, and matrix would be helpful.

So in conclusion, despite some missing information in the last few entries regarding their matrices, I can at least structure the known ones properly.
