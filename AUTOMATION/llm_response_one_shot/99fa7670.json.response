User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color

Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to transform an input tree into an output tree. The examples given show how the structure changes from the input to the output, but I'm not entirely sure how exactly the transformation works. Let me try to break it down.

Looking at the first example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (6x6) 0 [[...]] ... )

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (6x6) 0 [[...]] (5 (4,3)... ) (...))

It seems like each node in the input tree is being split into sub-nodes in the output tree. The numbers are changing, and the dimensions of some parts are altering too.

For instance, in the first example, the node with value 8 becomes two nodes: one with 5 (4,3) and another with 2 (1x1). Similarly, the node with 7 splits into a node with 6 (5,2) and another with something else. The output tree also has different matrices attached to these nodes.

I think each parent node is being expanded by its children, where the sum of the child's first numbers equals the parent's value? Let me check:

In the first example:
- Parent 8 splits into two children: (4,3) and something else. Wait, maybe it's that 5+2=7? Or no, because one is 5 and another seems to be 2 as well.

Wait, actually looking at numbers:

First input tree has nodes with values like 0, 8, 7, 6.

In the output:
- The node that was 8 becomes two children: (4,3) and maybe (something else). But in terms of matrices, it's splitting into a larger matrix. Hmm.

Maybe each parent is being split such that its value is distributed among its children based on some criteria. Also, the dimensions are changing—like from (6x6) to having two submatrices next to each other.

Wait, looking at the first output example:

The root node was 0 with a matrix of size (6x6). In the output, it's still there but now has children. The first child is a node with value 5 and dimensions (4,3), followed by another node with value 2 and dimensions (1x1).

So maybe each parent node's value is split into two parts, which are distributed to its children.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix in the input is being partitioned based on the child nodes' values. For example, if a node has value v, it might be split into k submatrices where the sizes correspond to certain criteria.

Wait, another approach: maybe each level of the tree corresponds to a certain operation or transformation. The depth of the tree and how each node splits could represent different operations like matrix multiplication steps.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me look at more examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Looking at Test Example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (7x8) ... )

Output Tree has similar structure but with different matrices and node splits.

It seems that the transformation involves keeping some nodes as they are, splitting others into subnodes based on their values or positions.

Perhaps each non-leaf node is being split such that its value is distributed among its children. For example, if a node has value v and two children, then one child could have a value of k and another of (v - k).

Looking at the first output tree:

- The root was 0 with no matrix.
- Then there's a node with 5 which splits into (4,3) and (1x1). Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps each non-zero number represents some kind of split. For example, nodes like 8,7,6 in the input are being transformed into multiple child nodes in the output.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should try to outline steps for transforming an input tree to an output tree:

1. Identify all parent nodes that can be split.
2. For each such node, determine how many children it will have and their values based on some rule (maybe sum of child values equals the parent's value).
3. Adjust the dimensions accordingly—like changing from 6x6 to two submatrices next to each other.

But without knowing exactly what rule is being applied here, I'm just guessing. Maybe in the examples:

- For the node with value 8 in the first input tree: its children are (5) and something else.
Wait, looking at outputs, perhaps it's that when a parent has two children, their values add up to the parent's value.

In the first example:
- Parent 8 splits into 5 and 2. So 5 + 2 =7? No, because 5+2=7 but the parent was 8 before. Wait, maybe not.

Wait no, in the input tree, node 8 is a leaf or something else?

Actually, perhaps each non-zero value represents how many splits occur. For example, a node with 8 would have eight children? But looking at outputs, it's just two or three.

Alternatively, think of each parent as being split into k submatrices where k depends on some rule—maybe binary splitting: each time you can split into left and right.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe the best approach is to look for how each part changes:

For instance, in the first input example:
- The root 0 has a matrix (6x6). In output, it's still there but now with children.
So maybe when a node splits, its parent's structure remains but gets split into submatrices.

Looking at matrices: from (6x6) to having two parts side by side. Maybe the original matrix is partitioned along columns or rows based on some split points determined by child nodes' values.

Wait, in the first example:

Original root was 0 with a (6x6) matrix.
In output, it's still present but now has children: one node is 5 (4,3), another is 2 (1x1). So perhaps each parent's value corresponds to how many submatrices or splits along some dimension.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers in parentheses after each node represent dimensions of a matrix associated with that node. Then when you split, these matrices are combined next to each other.

Wait, let me think: if a parent has two children, then their matrices would be placed side by side horizontally if it's columns, or stacked vertically for rows. That makes sense in terms of how matrices can be concatenated.

So maybe the transformation is:

- For each node with value v and matrix size (m x n), when you split into k children, arrange them either horizontally (side by side) or vertically (stacked on top of each other).

But then, how are these children arranged? What determines their order?

In the first example:
Parent 8 splits into two nodes: one with dimensions (4,3) and another with (1x1). Maybe 4 + 1 =5 for rows, or 3 + something else.

Wait, perhaps it's based on how many submatrices each node has. If a parent has k children, then the number of submatrices in its row direction is equal to the sum of their column dimensions? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, thinking about the matrix sizes:

For example, if you have two child nodes with (4x3) and (1x1), when placed side by side horizontally, the resulting matrix would be 5 rows x max(3,1)=3 columns. But wait, in input, it was a 6x6.

Alternatively, perhaps each split is determined based on some partition of the original dimension.

Wait, maybe for each node with value v and initial size (h x w), when splitting into k children, you divide h or w accordingly.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe instead of trying to reverse-engineer, think about writing code that can transform such a tree structure.

But without knowing the exact rules, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps each node with value v is transformed by having its matrix split along columns into (m x c) and another part.

Wait, in first example:

Original root was 0 with size (6x6). So maybe when you have a child node of (4,3), that implies splitting the original row count? Or column?

Because 4 + something =6 rows: so if it's split into two parts along columns, one part would be 4 columns and another 2 columns. But in the output, we see a matrix with dimensions like (5x7) for some nodes.

Alternatively, maybe when you have children, their row counts add up to the parent's row count or column counts.

Wait, let me think about each example:

First Output Tree:
- Root: 0 (6x6)
- Then child node: 5 with size (4,3)
- Another child: 2 with size (1x1)

So how does a 4x3 and a 1x1 fit into the original 6x6? Maybe they are placed side by side horizontally.

So if you have two matrices of sizes 4x3 and 1x1, combining them next to each other would give a matrix of size (5 rows x max(3,1)=3 columns). But wait, in the output tree, it's shown as something like [4,3] next to [1,1], so maybe concatenated along columns.

But how does that relate to 6x6? Maybe because 4+2=6 or something else. Hmm.

Wait, if you have two matrices of sizes (4x3) and (2x1), placing them side by side would give a matrix of size (5 rows x max(3,1)=3 columns). But that doesn't sum up to 6.

Alternatively, maybe the initial split is based on how many parts are needed for each child. For example, if a node has two children with dimensions (4x3) and (2x1), then when combined horizontally, you have size (5 rows x 3 columns). But original was 6 rows, which doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe the matrices in the output are not necessarily from splitting the parent's matrix but are just part of their own structure. Maybe it's more about how to build a tree where each node can have multiple children with specific dimensions based on some rules.

But without knowing what those rules are, it's hard to write code for that transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps there is an encoding or decoding happening—like Huffman coding—but I don't see the connection immediately.

Wait, maybe looking at all examples will help. Since we only have one example, but if more were provided, perhaps a pattern could emerge.

But given the limited information, it's difficult to deduce the exact transformation rules.

Alternatively, think about what each part represents:

The numbers in parentheses after each node: for example, (6x6), (5x7) etc. So probably represent matrix dimensions of some sort.

If we can figure out how these matrices are generated from their parent nodes, that would help.

But again, without knowing the exact rules or operations allowed on the matrices when splitting, it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps an alternative approach: if each node with a value represents a split into k children where k is equal to its value? For example, a node with 8 has eight children. Then arranging them in some order either horizontally or vertically.

But then, how are their dimensions determined?

Alternatively, maybe the number of children depends on something else, like the sum of rows or columns.

Wait, perhaps each child's dimension is based on dividing the parent's row count by column count or vice versa.

For example, a node with size (6x6) could split into two matrices: one with 4 rows and 3 columns, another with 2 rows and something else. But not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, maybe it's about prime factors or something.

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to note that transforming such trees likely involves recursively splitting nodes based on their values into submatrices whose dimensions sum up along rows and columns when arranged side by side or stacked. But without precise rules, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe each node with a number v splits into v children, each of which has matrix sizes determined by some division of the parent's dimensions.

But again, unclear.

Perhaps, given that this is about transforming tree structures where nodes represent matrices split into submatrices, and each child corresponds to a part of the matrix after splitting, one can model this with recursive functions:

- Each node takes its current matrix size (h x w)
- Splits it horizontally or vertically based on some criteria
- Creates children nodes for each split piece

But without knowing how many splits or along which axis, it's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the value in the parentheses after a node indicates whether to split and into how many submatrices. For example, if the value is 2, then split into two matrices; if 3, three, etc., arranging them either horizontally or vertically based on their sizes.

But again, without knowing how these splits are calculated from the parent's dimensions, it's challenging.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps I need to make an assumption about the transformation rules. For example:

1. Each node with value v will split into v children.
2. The original matrix is divided either horizontally or vertically based on some function of its size and the number of splits.
3. Children are arranged side by side along a chosen axis.

But since I don't have exact data, this might be speculative.

Alternatively, maybe each node with value v creates exactly two children: left child has (v rows x 1 column) and right child has remaining dimensions? But unclear.

Wait, in the first example:

Parent is 0 with size (6x6). It splits into a node of (4,3) and another of (2, something else), but the output shows two children: one 5x7 maybe?

Alternatively, perhaps each node's value v corresponds to how many columns are split. So for example:

Original matrix is h x w.

Split it vertically into k parts where k =v or some function of v.

Each child will then have size (h x (w /k)), placed side by side horizontally.

But 6x6 with a split based on value 8? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of row counts of children equals the parent's rows. For example:

Parent has r rows and c columns.

Split into v children: each child gets some number of rows such that their total is equal to r.

But then how are columns divided?

This still seems unclear.

Given all this, I think without more examples or precise rules, it's hard to write a specific transformation function. Therefore, perhaps the best answer is to explain that transforming such trees likely involves recursively splitting nodes into submatrices based on their parent dimensions and values, but exact method depends on defined rules which are not provided here.

Alternatively, if this were part of an algorithm or code, one would need functions for splitting matrices either horizontally or vertically at specific indices, then creating child nodes accordingly. But without knowing how many splits to make or along what axis, it's impossible.

In conclusion, while I attempted various hypotheses about the transformation rules, due to insufficient data, it's challenging to provide a precise method.
</think>

To address the problem of transforming such tree structures where each node represents a matrix split into submatrices based on its value and dimensions, we can outline a general approach. The exact transformation rules might not be provided, but here's a structured way to think about it:

1. **Understanding the Nodes**: Each node in the tree contains:
   - A numerical value indicating how many splits or subdivisions it will undergo.
   - Matrix dimensions (e.g., 6x6) representing its size.

2. **Splitting Rules**: The number of children a node will have is determined by its numerical value. For example, if a node has a value of `v`, it will split into `v` children.

3. **Matrix Division**:
   - Determine how to divide the parent matrix's dimensions (rows and columns) among the child nodes.
     - This could be done proportionally or based on specific rules for horizontal or vertical splits.
   - Ensure that when matrices are combined, their dimensions align correctly either horizontally (side by side) or vertically (stacked).

4. **Recursive Construction**: Use a recursive function to process each node:
   - For the current node, split it into child nodes according to its value and matrix dimensions.
   - Each child node is then processed in the same manner.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Implement functions for splitting matrices horizontally or vertically at specific indices.
   - Create child nodes with their respective dimensions based on the splits.
   - Recursively apply this process until all nodes are split as per their values.

6. **Potential Challenges**:
   - Without explicit rules for splitting (e.g., along which axis, how many times), it's challenging to implement accurately.
   - Ensuring that child matrices can be correctly recombined into the parent matrix after transformation is crucial.

7. **Example Transformation**: For a node with value 2 and dimensions 6x6:
   - Split horizontally or vertically based on defined rules (e.g., split rows equally).
   - Create two children, each with adjusted row or column counts.
   - Recursively process these children to further subdivide as needed.

8. **Testing**: Validate the transformation by checking if reassembling child matrices from a parent node reconstructs the original dimensions correctly.

In summary, while the exact rules for splitting are unclear without more information, this structured approach provides a framework for implementing such transformations once specific splitting rules are known.
