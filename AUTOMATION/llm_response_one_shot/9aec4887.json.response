User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this problem. It looks like there's a tree structure provided in some kind of nested list format, and then there are these numbers after it: (0 (0, 0) (16x16) 0 [[0...]], etc.). The user is asking for help with processing or analyzing this input.

First, I need to understand the structure. It seems like each node in the tree has some attributes: a value, left and right children, maybe an identifier, and then some data associated with it. The numbers after the tree might represent some kind of metrics or results from processing that tree.

The first thing I notice is the nested lists. Each part starts with a number, followed by something in parentheses, then another number in parentheses, maybe indicating dimensions like 16x16. Then there's more data inside brackets. It looks complex, but perhaps each bracketed section corresponds to different parts of the tree or different metrics.

I think I need to parse this structure somehow. Maybe write a function that can traverse the tree and extract relevant information from it. The numbers after the tree might be results of some calculations based on the tree's structure.

Looking at the user's example, there are multiple nodes with values like 0, 1, 2, etc., and each has children with specific dimensions. There are also lists of zeros or ones inside brackets, which probably represent something like counts or presence indicators.

I wonder if this is related to game theory, maybe calculating Grundy numbers for each node? Grundy numbers are used in combinatorial games to determine winning positions. Each position's Grundy number is the mex (minimum excludant) of its children's Grundy numbers. That could explain why each node has a value and some data associated with it.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the Grundy number for each subtree based on its structure. The 16x16 might indicate that this node has 16 possible moves or something similar. The zeros in the bracketed lists might represent positions available after a move, which could help compute the mex.

Let me try breaking it down step by step:

1. Parse the tree structure into nodes with their respective left and right children.
2. For each node, determine its Grundy number based on its children's Grundy numbers using mex.
3. Accumulate some kind of result from these Grundy numbers, possibly summing them up or tracking maximums.

I need to make sure I correctly handle the nested structure because it seems quite deep with multiple levels and branches. Maybe a recursive approach would work where each node is processed after its children are processed.

Also, considering that one of the nodes has (1x5) dimensions, perhaps indicating 5 possible moves or something similar, and another has 5x5 which might represent some board-like structure with 25 positions.

The zeros in the bracketed sections could indicate invalid moves or unavailable positions, so they shouldn't contribute to the mex calculation. The ones would be valid moves leading to further nodes.

I should also check if there are overlapping subproblems; memoization might help in caching computed Grundy numbers for each node to avoid redundant calculations.

Once I have all the Grundy numbers calculated, the final result could be derived from them. It's unclear exactly what the user is asking for—whether it's just computing Grundy numbers or summing them up or finding some maximum value.

In the test example, there are multiple nodes with different values and structures, each contributing to the overall result. The zeros in their data might mean they don't contribute positively, while ones do. So perhaps the final result is based on how many nodes have a certain property, like Grundy number zero or something else.

I think I should outline the steps clearly:

1. Parse the input into a tree structure where each node has its value and children.
2. Traverse the tree recursively to compute Grundy numbers for each subtree.
3. Use mex function which takes the set of Grundy numbers from children, finds the smallest non-negative integer not in that set.
4. For each node's data (the bracketed sections), determine how they influence the Grundy number—maybe by considering only ones as valid moves or positions contributing to the mex calculation.

I might need to write code for this, but since it's a thought process, I'll simulate how I'd approach coding it:

- Create a function that parses each part into nodes.
- For each node, if it has children, recursively compute their Grundy numbers.
- Collect all Grundy numbers from the children and apply mex to get the current node's Grundy number.
- Store these numbers somewhere or combine them according to the problem's needs.

I also need to consider edge cases, like leaves with no children—those would have a Grundy number of 0 since there are no moves available. Nodes with only zeros in their data might contribute differently based on how I process those.

Wait, looking at the test example, some nodes have values followed by (16x16) or similar dimensions, which could represent board sizes for each node's game state. The bracketed sections likely contain positions or moves available from that state.

If a node has children with Grundy numbers 0 and 1, mex would be 2 because it's the smallest non-negative integer not present. But if all child Grundies are either 0 or 1, mex could skip over 2 depending on what's missing.

But since I'm dealing with multiple nodes in a complex tree, I need to make sure each node is processed correctly without interfering with others. Memoization will help keep the computation efficient.

Overall, my plan is solid: parse the structure, compute Grundy numbers recursively using mex, and then derive the final result based on these computations.

It seems you're working on a problem involving game theory, specifically calculating Grundy numbers for nodes in a tree structure. Here's a step-by-step explanation to help you get started:

   - Convert the nested list format into a tree data structure where each node contains its value and children.
   - Each node may have left and right children, which themselves can be nodes or leaves.

2. **Compute Grundy Numbers Recursively:**
   - Use recursion to traverse each subtree starting from the root.
   - For each node, calculate its Grundy number (G) based on its children's Grundy numbers using the mex function:
     - Mex (minimum excludant): The smallest non-negative integer not present in a set of integers.
   - Formula: G(node) = mex{ G(child1), G(child2), ... }

3. **Handle Child Nodes and Data:**
   - For each node, extract relevant data from the bracketed sections that might influence its Grundy number calculation (e.g., valid moves indicated by 1s).

4. **Derive Final Result:**
   - Based on computed Grundy numbers, determine the final result as required—whether it's a specific sum, maximum value, or another metric.

**Example Calculation:**

Consider two child nodes with Grundy numbers 0 and 1:
- Mex {0, 1} = 2

Thus, the current node's Grundy number is 2.

This approach ensures each subtree contributes correctly to computing the overall game state. Implementing this in code would involve parsing, recursion, and memoization for efficiency.
