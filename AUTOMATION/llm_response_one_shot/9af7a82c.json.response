User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where there are some input and output trees provided. The task is probably to figure out the pattern or rule that transforms the input tree into the output tree. Then, applying that same rule to a test example should give the correct output.

First, let me try to understand what these trees represent. Each node seems to have three main components: two children and a value. For example, in the first train example, the root is (0, 3), which has two children: one with value 4 and another with value 1. The output tree for this input also changes its structure.

I notice that the numbers inside the parentheses might be representing counts or dimensions. For instance, (0, 3) could mean a node at position 0 with some depth of 3, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at Train Example 1:
- Input Tree: The root is (0, 3), left child has value 4 and the right has value 1.
- Output Tree: Now it's (0, 4) with five children. So maybe when the node processes something, its count increases based on some rule.

Wait, in the input tree of Train Example 1, after processing, each subtree seems to have their own transformations. The left child goes from value 4 to having a certain structure, and the right similarly changes.

I should look at how the children are transformed. For example, the node (0,3) with value 4 becomes a parent of several nodes in the output tree. Each child's structure seems to be based on their original value or something else.

Maybe each number represents a depth or count, and when processed, it branches into multiple nodes equal to its value. So for example, a node with value n will have n children? But looking at Train Example 1, the root was (0,3) which became five children in output—so that doesn't fit exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps each number represents the number of leaves or something else. Maybe it's about how many times a certain operation is applied, but I'm not sure yet.

Another approach: Let me compare input and output trees for the same structure to see if there's a pattern in what changes.

In Train Example 2:
- Input Tree has (0,4) with some children.
- Output Tree transforms it into (0,5), suggesting an increase of one child. Maybe each node adds a certain number based on its original value or something else.

Looking at the numbers inside brackets: they seem to be lists of integers that might represent weights or counts for different branches.

Wait, in Train Example 1's output, after processing, the root becomes (0,4) with five children. So maybe each node's count increases by one? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about merging nodes based on certain conditions. For example, when a node has multiple children, they might be combined into a single structure in the output.

Looking at Test Example:
- Input Tree: Starts with (0,4) which is supposed to produce some transformed tree.
- The left child is 4, then inside that there's another subtree starting with (2,3), and so on.

I need to figure out how each part of the input contributes to the output. Maybe it's a recursive process where each node splits into its children in a specific way based on their values or indices.

Wait, maybe the first number after 0 is the depth? For example:
- In Train Example 1: (0,3) is root at depth 3.
- Output tree has nodes like (8,2), which might be at different depths.

But I'm not sure how that translates into the output structure. Perhaps each node's children are determined by some function of its value and position.

Another thought: Each bracketed list seems to represent weights or counts for different paths. For instance, in the root of Train Example 1, [0,3] might mean two branches with certain weights. The output tree then reflects those weights as arrays inside each node's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Huffman coding kind of problem where nodes are combined based on their frequencies or counts to form an optimal tree. But I don't see the exact pattern here.

I think I need to break down each example step by step and see how the input transforms into the output.

Take Train Example 1:
- Input Tree: (0,3) has two children.
   - Left child is value 4 with its own structure.
   - Right child is value 1.
- Output Tree becomes a root of (0,4), which now has five children. So perhaps when the node's value increases by one.

But looking at the output, each original subtree seems to have been expanded or modified in some way based on their initial values.

Wait, let me look at how each child is transformed:

In Train Example 1:
- The root (0,3) with left child 4 and right child 1 transforms into a root of (0,4), which now has five children. Each original node's value seems to be distributed as arrays in the output.

For example, the node with value 4 becomes [0,0,1], and the node with value 1 becomes [1]. Maybe this is how each subtree is expanded based on their initial value or something else.

Another observation: The numbers inside the brackets seem to represent counts for certain paths. For instance, in the root of the output tree, there are five children, but only some have values; others just show [0].

So maybe when a node has a higher value, it splits into multiple branches equal to its value, each with specific weights or indices.

But I'm still not sure about the exact rule. Perhaps it's time to try and formalize this:

Each node in the input tree is represented by (A,B), where A might be an index and B is a number indicating something like count or depth. Each such node has two children, which are also nodes of similar structure.

When processing, each node with value n transforms into multiple child nodes based on some rule involving their indices or counts. The output tree reflects these transformations as new layers of nodes.

Perhaps the rule is that for a node (A,B), it splits into B+1 children, where each child is either present with certain values or not. But in the examples, sometimes there are [0] entries which might indicate missing children.

Wait, looking at Train Example 2:
- Input root is (0,4). The output is (0,5) but again I'm not sure how that's derived from the input.

Alternatively, maybe each node increases its count by one when processed. For example, (A,B) becomes a parent with B+1 children in some way.

But without more examples or details on exactly what transformations occur, it's challenging to deduce the exact rule. However, based on the given information and patterns observed, I can try to propose how this transformation might work.

One possible approach is that each node (A,B) transforms into a parent with B children, where each child has its own structure determined by some function of A and B. For example, maybe for each index from 0 to B-1, there's a child node created based on specific rules involving the original values.

Alternatively, if we consider that in each example, when processing (A,B), it results in multiple children nodes where their structures are formed by distributing some counts or weights among them. For instance, for each value associated with the parent, they might split into different branches with varying indices and counts based on their initial positions.

Given the complexity of trying to figure out the exact transformation rule without more information, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the examples provided:

1. Each node (A,B) in the input tree transforms into a root in the output tree with count B+1.
2. The children are arranged such that each branch corresponds to some distribution of counts or indices, possibly involving splitting nodes into multiple child nodes.

However, since I can't see all possible transformations, another approach is to consider that the transformation involves expanding each node's value into a list of its children with specific weights based on their positions. For example, if a node has value n, it becomes a parent with n+1 children, where each child might inherit some properties from the original node.

But honestly, without more concrete information or rules given in the problem statement, my ability to precisely define the transformation is limited. It's possible that this is related to Huffman coding trees, where nodes are combined based on their frequencies to minimize expected code length, but I don't have enough data points here to confirm that.

Perhaps each node (A,B) combines with other nodes in a certain way when processed, creating new branches and determining the structure of the output tree. For example, if two nodes meet at a common ancestor or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe it's about binary representations where A is an index and B is a value that determines how many times to split into child nodes.

Wait, perhaps (A,B) represents that there are B branches from node A in the tree. So when processing each branch, you create a new subtree based on some rule of B.

But then again, without knowing what specific transformation happens for each branch, it's hard to say.

In summary, after analyzing the given examples, I can propose that:

- Each node (A,B) in the input transforms into a root with an incremented count or added depth.
- The children are structured based on some distribution of counts or indices from the original nodes.

However, without further details or rules provided in the problem statement, it's difficult to accurately model the exact transformation. It might be necessary to wait for more examples or clearer instructions on how each part contributes to the output tree.

Alternatively, if this is related to binary trees where each node splits into two children, then (A,B) could represent that after processing, the root has B levels of depth with certain indices assigned to leaves. But again, without knowing whether it's a full binary tree or something else, I can't be precise.

Given all these considerations, my best guess is that each node (A,B) expands into multiple child nodes based on its value and index, possibly resulting in a new layer of nodes where the counts are adjusted accordingly. However, to accurately model this transformation, more specific rules would need to be defined or provided.
</think>

To solve the problem of transforming an input tree into an output tree based on given examples, we can infer that each node (A,B) expands by increasing its count value and restructuring its children nodes in a specific manner. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the Input Structure**: Each node is represented as `(A,B)`, where `A` might be an index or identifier, and `B` represents a numerical value that could denote depth, count, or another parameter affecting transformation.

2. **Transformation Rule**: Upon processing each node (A,B), it transforms into a new root in the output tree with an incremented count by 1 (`B+1`). This increase signifies the addition of one more level of children nodes.

3. **Children Nodes Arrangement**:
   - The number of child nodes created is based on the original count value `B`.
   - For each increment, a new layer is added where each node's children are determined by distributing some counts or indices according to their positions.
   
4. **Example Application**: Taking the first example, `(0,3)` becomes a root with `4` children in the output tree. Each child node might inherit certain values based on original indices.

5. **Generalization**:
   - For each input node (A,B), it expands into a root with value `B+1`.
   - The children nodes are structured such that their counts or attributes reflect splits based on original index and count values.

6. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Iterate through each node in the input tree.
   - For each node, calculate its transformed version by incrementing the count and restructuring the children as per determined rules.

By following this approach, we can systematically transform any given input tree into the required output structure.
