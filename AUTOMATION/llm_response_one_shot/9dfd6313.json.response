User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Okay, so I have this input tree with a structure that includes some numbers and matrices. Let me try to break it down.

First, the main tree starts with 0 (0,0) which probably means two children, both labeled 0. Then there's a (6x6), so maybe a matrix of size 6x6? That might be part of one of the nodes. 

Looking at the input example, it seems like each node has elements: left and right branches, followed by something that looks like an identifier or number, then another branch which is probably a list of child trees. The matrices are in parentheses with sizes like (5x5), (6x6), etc.

In the output tree from Train Example 1, I notice there's more structure after each main node. There are numbers attached to some nodes and matrices that seem to represent identity matrices or permutations. 

Wait, for instance, in the first output example, there's a [4x4] matrix with ones on the diagonal. That looks like an identity matrix of size 4. Similarly, another part has a [5x5] identity matrix.

So maybe each number corresponds to some operation or transformation applied at that node, and the matrices represent how those transformations are structured or what operations they perform.

Looking closer, in the input tree for Test Example, there's a (6x6) matrix with children nodes like 6 (5,2), 3 (2,0), etc. The output seems to reorganize these into different structures, perhaps grouping similar numbers together and applying their respective matrices.

I think each number before the brackets is an identifier for that node, and the numbers after are indices pointing to child trees. So when you have a main node with children, those children might be connected in some way based on those index numbers.

Also, the (1x1), (2x1), etc., suggest different sizes of matrices. Maybe these represent transformation layers or connections between nodes.

Hmm, perhaps each number is like a layer identifier and the following numbers are the indices to their child nodes that define how this layer connects to others. The matrices then might be showing the connections or weights between these layers.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact mapping, but it seems like each node's structure defines its children's placement and type based on those index numbers, with matrices indicating some transformational properties of those connections.
</think>

The input tree is structured with nodes that include a number, two child branches (left and right), an identifier or operation label, another branch with child trees, and a matrix. The output tree transforms this structure by reorganizing the children based on index numbers and applying matrices that represent specific operations or transformations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Input Structure:**
   - Each node starts with two numbers (left and right branches).
   - An identifier (number) follows, which may indicate an operation or transformation.
   - A list of child nodes follows, each enclosed in brackets.

2. **Analyzing the Matrices:**
   - Matrices like `(5x5)` define the size, indicating 5 rows and columns.
   - The content inside matrices varies; some are identity matrices (ones on the diagonal), others have different configurations.

3. **Transforming the Input to Output:**
   - For each main node in the input tree:
     - The children nodes are reorganized based on their index numbers, indicating how they connect or transform.
     - Matrices attached to these children define specific transformations (e.g., identity operations).

4. **Example Transformation for Test Example:**
   - Input Node Structure: `0 (0, 0) (6x6) ...`
   - Output Nodes:
     - The main node is split into two branches.
     - Each branch leads to a new structure with its own matrix and reorganized children.

**Final Answer:**

The output tree transforms the input by restructuring child nodes according to their index numbers, applying specific matrices that represent transformations. This process involves grouping connected nodes based on their indices and using matrices to define how these connections operate or transform data.
