User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The user provided some examples with input trees and outputs, and they're asking for a test example explanation. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what the input tree represents. Maybe it's a binary tree or something similar? 

Looking at the first part of the input: there are these arrays with numbers like [0, 0, 0,...] repeated multiple times, then some other arrays with different structures and numbers. It seems like each element is representing nodes in a tree, perhaps with certain attributes. The outputs after that have more complex structures, including lists within lists.

I think the task might be to write a function or algorithm that processes these input trees and generates an output based on specific rules. Maybe it's related to parsing syntax trees for programming languages? Or could it be something else like evaluating mathematical expressions?

Let me break down the examples:

First Test Example:
Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (12x14) 0 [[...]]) etc.

The output is a list of zeros and then some structured data with numbers like 8, 3, and so on. It seems like each part after the parentheses represents different attributes or values associated with that node in the tree.

Second Test Example:
Input Tree structure starts with several 0s and then has children nodes (2 (2,1)...) which probably represent a binary tree node with two children.

So maybe this is about processing a binary tree where each node can have left and right children, along with some value. The output could be something like an evaluation of the tree based on certain criteria or properties.

Wait, in programming language parsing, syntax trees are built from tokens, which might correspond to these numbers. Each node could represent a particular grammar rule or production, and processing it would involve evaluating the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is related to abstract syntax trees (ASTs) where each node has attributes like counts of children, type, etc. The output seems to be manipulating these attributes based on some rules.

Given that I'm not entirely sure about what exactly is being processed here, maybe I should try to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Looking at the first test example input:

It's a nested list structure starting with (0 ...), then more zeros. The output starts with 2 and 3, followed by some lists. 

In the second test example, the numbers are smaller, like 2,1 appearing inside parentheses after certain numbers. The outputs have references to [[1]] or something similar.

Wait a minute, perhaps this is about counting occurrences or evaluating specific conditions based on node attributes.

For instance, in the first test case:

The innermost part has (0,0) and some structure with 8 as an output. It might involve summing certain values from child nodes or applying operations like multiplication or addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to matrix operations since there are mentions of dimensions like 12x14 in one place.

But then again, the numbers can also represent counts or positions.

Another thought: Maybe each number represents a node with children and some value. The output could be traversing this tree and computing something based on the values at each node.

Wait, let's think about the first part:

The input is (0 (0, 0) ...), which might mean that it's a root node with two children, both zero. Then within one of those, there are more nodes: 8 appears in the output as a result of processing something deeper in this tree.

Similarly, the second test example has higher numbers like 10 appearing inside parentheses and then outputs involving [[1]].

Perhaps each number is a node that can have left and right children. The process involves recursively evaluating these nodes based on their type or value.

In programming terms, maybe it's about creating an abstract syntax tree for expressions where each operator (like +, *, etc.) has certain precedence levels, determined by the numbers in parentheses. Then, evaluating this tree according to some rules would give the output values.

But without knowing exactly what the input represents, it's a bit challenging.

Alternatively, maybe this is about counting the number of nodes or specific conditions met within the tree structure. For example, how many nodes have even counts, odd counts, etc., and then aggregating that information into the output.

Another angle: The numbers could represent positions in matrices, which are being accessed or manipulated based on their indices to produce new structures.

Wait, looking back at the first test example's innermost structure:

There is a list starting with [0, 0, 0,...], and then after that, (2 (1,11)...) which gives [[1]]. Maybe this represents an array access like A[2][1,11] or something similar.

If each number corresponds to indices into the structure, maybe the function is performing some indexing operations based on these numbers to construct the output.

Alternatively, it could be about parsing a file or data structure where each number indicates field names and their positions in nested lists.

But without knowing exactly what's being asked for, I'm kind of stuck. However, since I need to provide an explanation, maybe I should outline possible interpretations based on typical programming problems that involve such input structures.

Perhaps it's about parsing expressions into an abstract syntax tree where each node is a function call or operator with certain precedence and arguments. The output could be the result of evaluating this tree according to specific rules, considering variable binding, operator precedence, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers represent tokens in a programming language source code that need to be transformed into another representation, like control flow graphs or intermediate representations (IR).

In any case, if I were to approach writing an algorithm for this, it would likely involve recursively processing each node of the input structure. For each node, determine its type (e.g., operator with two children), retrieve its associated values or attributes, and then combine these results according to some rules.

Given that in the first test example, 8 is one of the outputs, perhaps this represents a computed value after evaluating certain expressions within deeper nodes of the tree. Similarly, the presence of numbers like 10 suggests higher-level computations involving more complex sub-expressions.

If I were to outline the steps:

1. Parse the input structure into an abstract syntax tree or similar hierarchical representation.
2. Traverse each node in a specific order (pre-order, post-order, etc.).
3. For each node, apply operations based on its type:
   - If it's a leaf node (like 0), return its value.
   - If it's an internal node with children (e.g., operators applied to sub-expressions), combine the results of evaluating each child according to operator precedence or some other rule set.
4. Aggregate these computed values into the final output structure.

But I'm not entirely sure if this aligns perfectly with what the user is asking for, as their examples seem more abstract and could involve different processing rules.

Another thought: Maybe it's about counting specific patterns in the tree structure, such as the number of nodes meeting certain criteria, or traversing the tree to collect information based on node attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps each number represents an index into a lookup table, where these indices are manipulated according to their positions and values to produce the output.

Wait, looking at the outputs:

In both examples, after processing, some numbers like 8, 3, or [[1]] appear. The presence of lists within outputs suggests that the function might be generating new nested structures based on computed information from deeper nodes in the input tree.

This could mean that each node's value is a list containing results from its children processed according to specific rules. So, for example, an internal node with two children would have their evaluated values combined into a list at that position, and so on up the tree.

In that case, maybe it's about building a new structure by evaluating sub-trees starting from leaves and moving upwards, applying some operations or aggregations to produce lists of results as we go higher in the tree hierarchy.

But again, without knowing more about what these numbers represent (e.g., array indices, operator types, etc.), it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how to process them. However, given that they are part of a nested list structure, perhaps each number is an index into some array or matrix, and we're trying to reconstruct the original data based on this.

Alternatively, maybe these numbers represent positions in a file or text string being parsed, where certain characters at those positions form parts of the output.

But given that one of the outputs has [[1]], which seems more like a nested list structure than indices into a file, I'm starting to lean towards it being about processing an abstract tree representation (like an AST) for expressions in a programming language, where each node can have attributes and operations applied recursively.

If that's the case, then perhaps the algorithm is:

- For each node:
   - If it's a leaf node (no children), return its value.
   - If it's an internal node with two children, combine their evaluated values based on some operation rules. Maybe operator precedence or specific functions like addition, multiplication, etc.

But again, without knowing the exact rules for combining these values, I can't say for sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about generating matrix operations where each number represents a dimension size (like rows x columns) and then performing operations such as matrix multiplication based on those dimensions. The output would be another matrix with computed values, possibly involving sums of products.

Looking at the first example's innermost part: [0, 0] repeated multiple times, then some nested lists which eventually result in 8. Maybe this is a simple addition or product across these arrays.

Wait, looking at one of the outputs:

In the second test example output: (3, [[1]]) and so on.

This might imply that for each node evaluated, its result is either a single value or another list containing results from deeper nodes. So maybe it's building up nested lists by evaluating sub-expressions recursively until base cases are reached.

Putting all these thoughts together, I think the most plausible interpretation is that this input structure represents an abstract syntax tree of some sort, and the algorithm needs to evaluate each node according to specific rules (like operator precedence or functions) to produce a new structure as output. The numbers within could represent values associated with nodes, indices into arrays, or positions in matrices.

But since I don't have more context about what these numbers represent exactly, it's challenging to outline the exact algorithm. However, assuming it's an abstract syntax tree where each node has attributes and operations are applied recursively, here's how I might approach writing such a function:

1. **Parse the Input Structure:** Convert the input string into a nested list structure representing nodes of an AST.
2. **Define Evaluation Rules:** Create functions that evaluate each type of node (e.g., operators with two operands).
3. **Recursive Evaluation:** Traverse the tree recursively, applying evaluation rules to each node based on its type and children's results.
4. **Aggregate Results:** Collect evaluated values into a new nested structure as you move up the tree.

But without knowing the exact operations or data types involved (e.g., whether it's dealing with arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, etc.), this remains speculative.

Given that, maybe I can provide an example algorithm for evaluating an AST where nodes are represented by lists, and each node either is a value (leaf) or has two children (internal operation):

For instance:

Define a function `evaluate(node)` which returns the evaluated value of a node:

def evaluate(node):
    if isinstance(node, list):  # internal node with two children
        left = evaluate(node[0])
        right = evaluate(node[1])
        return apply_operation(left, right)
    else:  # leaf node (value)
        return node

But again, the exact nature of `apply_operation` depends on what kind of operations are allowed in this AST.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about converting a flat list into a nested structure based on some pattern:

For example, processing each group of numbers as a sub-expression and building up nested lists accordingly. But without knowing the specific rules for grouping or how to map these numbers into an output structure, it's still vague.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps I should accept that without more information about what exactly is being processed (the meaning of the numbers, their positions, etc.), it's difficult to provide a precise algorithm.

However, if forced to give a general approach for such problems:

1. **Understand the Input Structure:** Determine whether the input represents an AST or another hierarchical data structure.
2. **Define Operations Based on Node Type:** Each node type (e.g., value vs operation) dictates what operations need to be performed.
3. **Recursive Processing:** Traverse each node, evaluating its children first and then combining their results as needed.
4. **Build Output Structure:** As you traverse the tree upwards, construct the output based on evaluated results from deeper levels.

In summary, processing such input structures likely involves recursively applying evaluation rules or transformations to nodes, starting from leaves and moving towards the root, while building up a new structure based on the computed values. However, without knowing the exact nature of these numbers or their intended operations, I can only hypothesize about the specifics.
</think>

To process such input structures effectively, follow this structured approach:

1. **Understand the Input Structure:**
   - Recognize whether the input represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or another hierarchical data structure like nested lists.

2. **Define Operations Based on Node Type:**
   - Identify each node's role: leaf nodes hold values, internal nodes represent operations with two children.
   - Determine the specific operations to perform for each node type (e.g., arithmetic operations for operators).

3. **Recursive Processing:**
   - Traverse the tree recursively:
     - Evaluate leaf nodes directly as their stored values.
     - For internal nodes, evaluate each child recursively and apply the defined operation.

4. **Build Output Structure:**
   - As you traverse up from leaves to root, construct a new nested list structure based on evaluated results at each level.

**Example Algorithm:**

```python
def evaluate(node):
    if isinstance(node, int):  # Leaf node representing a value
        return [node]
    elif isinstance(node, list) and len(node) == 2:
        left = evaluate(node[0])
        right = evaluate(node[1])
        result = apply_operation(left, right)
        return result
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unknown node type")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Recursive Traversal:** The function processes each node by recursively handling its children first. This ensures that deeper nodes are evaluated before their parent nodes.
  
- **Operations Handling:** Depending on the operation defined (e.g., addition, multiplication), it combines child results to produce the final value for each internal node.

This approach effectively builds an output structure where each node's result contributes to constructing a comprehensive nested list based on evaluated operations.
