User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where there's an input tree and a test example. Both of them have similar structures but with different values. My task is to figure out how the output tree is derived from these inputs.

First, let me try to understand what each part of the input represents. It looks like it's structured as follows:

1. The first number is 5 or 2, which might indicate some kind of operation count or level.
2. Then there are pairs in parentheses: something like (x, y) which could be coordinates or parameters for a node.
3. After that, another number indicating maybe the size or type of the node.
4. Then a value followed by [[ ... ]] which seems to contain some matrix or array data.

Looking at the input tree:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0,...],...] 

Wait, that's confusing because there are two zeros after "10x10". Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's part of the structure. Then another node with value 5 and some data.

Similarly, in the test example:

(0 (0, 2) ... ) etc.

So maybe each tree is composed of nodes connected by edges defined by their coordinates. Each node has a size or type, which might determine how it processes its children.

The output trees show that starting from certain points (like 5 and 4 in the input), the data propagates through these connections, updating values based on some rules.

I think each node at position (x,y) with value v is connected to another node at (a,b). The rule might involve combining or transforming the arrays inside [[...]] based on their positions. For example, if two nodes are connected via a 2x2 matrix, they might average or take some combination of their values.

I also notice that in both input and output trees, certain coordinates have specific transformations applied. For instance, (0,0) becomes [0]s in the initial array but then gets updated to [[1]] after processing. Similarly, other nodes like (3,1), (6,9), etc., have their arrays transformed based on connections.

Perhaps each node's value is a transformation matrix that affects its children or ancestors. When two nodes are connected by a 2x2 connection, they exchange values in a way that combines the matrices using some operation like averaging or specific combinations.

I need to figure out how these transformations occur step by step, maybe simulating the processing through each node and applying operations based on their connections until I reach the final output arrays.
</think>

To solve this problem, we analyze the structure of the input trees and derive transformation rules for propagating values between nodes. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Node Components**:
   - Each node is defined by coordinates (x,y) connected to another node at specific positions.
   - Nodes have associated values followed by an array of numbers, likely representing weights or coefficients.

2. **Determine Transformation Rules**:
   - When nodes are connected via a 2x2 matrix connection, their arrays undergo transformations based on predefined operations like averaging neighboring elements or applying specific combinations (e.g., [[1,1],[1,1]]).

3. **Simulate Propagation**:
   - Starting from the initial node values and applying transformation rules to each connected node step by step.
   - Update the arrays according to these transformations until all nodes have been processed.

4. **Observe Final Output**:
   - After processing through all connections, observe how the arrays evolve into the final output structure.
   - Confirm that the final arrays align with the expected transformation outcomes based on propagation rules.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The process involves simulating value transformations across connected nodes following specific matrix operations to achieve the desired output structure.

The detailed steps and exact transformation functions would depend on more precise definitions of how each connection type (e.g., 1x1, 2x2) affects the arrays, which weren't fully specified in the problem statement.
