User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've been given this problem where I have to figure out how a certain transformation happens based on the input and output trees provided. The user has included some code snippets with numbers and parentheses that look like they're describing tree structures. My task is probably to understand what these transformations mean and maybe replicate or explain them.

First, let me parse through the examples given. There's an initial example where a structure starts as [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], etc., which seems like a grid of zeros. Then there are some references to operations like (8 (1,8) (2x2) 1 [[1,1],[0,1]]). This looks like each part is describing a node in the tree with children and possibly a matrix associated with it.

In the first test example, the input starts with a big grid of zeros, size 13x13. Then there are operations like (6 (2,2) etc.), similar to the initial example but scaled up. The output seems to have some transformations based on these nodes and their children matrices.

I think each number represents a node in the tree, with its position and how it's transformed by the child nodes. Maybe the numbers correspond to something like indices or layers, while the tuples describe relationships between nodes, possibly through matrix operations.

Looking at the first example:

The input starts as (0 (0,0) (4x4) 0 ...). Then there are children with their own transformations: one is [[1,1],[1,0]], another is [[1,1],[0,1]], and so on. The output tree mirrors this but with different transformations.

Similarly, in the test example, a big grid leads to operations involving matrices like [[0,1],[1,1]] which might represent some kind of transformation matrix applied at each step.

I suspect that each node's operation is based on combining its children using some sort of matrix multiplication or transformation. The numbers (like 6,8) could be identifiers for the nodes, and their positions determine how they're connected in the tree structure.

Maybe to solve this, I need to figure out how the initial grid gets transformed into the final tree by applying these operations step by step, perhaps through recursion where each node's value is determined by its children matrices. It might involve some form of dynamic programming or breadth-first processing.

I should probably start by analyzing a smaller example and see if I can replicate the transformations manually before attempting to generalize it for larger grids like 13x13.

To solve this problem, we need to understand how each node in the tree is transformed based on its children. Each node has a value (e.g., 0, 6, 8), positions of its parent nodes (e.g., (2,2)), and an associated transformation matrix.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Node Structure:**
   - Each node is represented as `(value (posX, posY) (size x size) value matrix)`.
   - The `value` indicates the initial or transformed state of the node.
   - `posX, posY` denote the positions in a grid structure.
   - The matrix defines how transformations are applied.

2. **Analyze Transformations:**
   - For each node, its transformation is influenced by its parent nodes based on their positions and associated matrices.
   - The initial grid starts with all zeros, and transformations propagate through these nodes to build the final tree structure.

3. **Apply Matrices Sequentially:**
   - Starting from the root (node 0), apply its matrix to the initial grid values at its specific position.
   - Recursively process each child node, updating their positions based on their parent's transformation rules.

4. **Construct Output Tree:**
   - Build the output tree by systematically applying transformations according to each node's configuration and matrix operations.

**Final Answer:**

The problem involves transforming an initial grid structure into a complex tree using defined node operations that involve specific matrices at each level of the tree. Each node's transformation is based on its position relative to its parent nodes, with the final output tree being constructed through these hierarchical transformations.
