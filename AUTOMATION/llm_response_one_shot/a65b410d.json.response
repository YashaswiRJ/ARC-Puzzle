User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've been given these three examples of input and output trees. Hmm, it's a bit confusing at first glance because the notation is quite nested and uses parentheses and commas in a specific way. Let me try to parse through them step by step.

Starting with Train Example 1:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (7x9) 0 [[0,0,...], ...] )

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (7x9) 0 [[0,0,...], ...] (3 (0,0)(2x6)1[[1,1...],[1,1,0]](2 (2,0)(1x4)2[[1,1,1]])(1 (3,0)(3x3)3[[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]))))

Okay, so the input has some structure where 7x9 is a matrix or array size. The output seems to have similar components but modified.

Looking at Train Example 2:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (7x9) 0 [[...], ...] )

Output Tree:
The same as the first example's output except it has an additional element with [1,1,1].

Wait, maybe each example adds to the output tree by appending something. Let me check.

Test Example seems similar to the input of Train Example 2 but different in size and the structure inside.

Hmm, perhaps the pattern is that for a given (n x m) matrix, we're processing it into sub-arrays based on some conditions or rules.

Looking at how each output tree branches out. It seems like the main function here might be splitting the initial array into parts where each part has certain properties.

For instance, in Train Example 1's Output:

After the first level, there are three parts: one with (0,0) size (2x6), another with (2,0)(1x4), and a third with (3,0)(3x3). Each of these seems to represent different groupings or sub-trees.

Perhaps each number in parentheses is a tuple indicating some parameters. The first part might be the type, then other attributes like size or something else.

Maybe it's about counting how many 1s there are in specific rows or columns? Or perhaps it's grouping consecutive elements based on certain conditions.

Looking at the matrices:

In Train Example 2 Input:
The sub-array is [[0,0], [0,0], ..., [0,0]] and then a few ones towards the end. The output adds more structure to that.

Hmm, maybe when processing each row of the matrix, if there are consecutive zeros or certain patterns, it groups them accordingly in the output tree.

Wait, perhaps for each (n x m) section, we're breaking it down into sub-trees based on how many 1s are present. For example, looking at Train Example 1's Output: There's a [3 (0,0)(2x6)...], which might correspond to the three rows that had two consecutive 1s.

But in the input matrix of Train Example 1, I don't see any ones; it's all zeros. So maybe that part is not about counting but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each sub-structure represents a certain operation applied on the initial array. For example, processing rows into columns or vice versa.

Wait, another approach: maybe each number in parentheses corresponds to an index or layer, and within each layer, we have branches based on some criteria like max, min, sum of elements, etc.

Looking at Train Example 1's Output:
The first sub-tree after the initial is (3 (0,0)(2x6) ...). Maybe this represents a row-wise operation where the maximum value in that part is considered.

But all values are zero except for some ones. Hmm, perhaps it's about the number of non-zero elements or something else.

Wait, another thought: The numbers after each opening parenthesis might be parameters controlling how to split the array. For example, (0,0) could mean not splitting further, while higher numbers indicate more splits.

In Train Example 1's Output:
- After initial (7x9), we have three sub-trees with parameters (2,6), (1,4), and (3,3). These might be the sizes of each sub-partitioned array.

Similarly, in Test Example Input: (9x9) leads to a partitioning into two parts: one (5x7) and another (5x2).

Wait, that makes sense because 5+5=10 but wait, 7+2 is 9. No, actually 5x7 +5x2 would be 35+10=45, which doesn't match the initial size of 81 in 9x9.

Hmm, maybe it's rows being split into chunks. For example, (n x m) might represent splitting n elements into sub-groups of sizes given by m.

But how? Let me check:

In Train Example 1: The main array is 7x9. It gets partitioned into three parts with (2x6), which would be two rows each split into six columns, then one part with (1x4) and another with (3x3). Wait, that doesn't add up because 2+1+3=6 but the initial is seven.

Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps these numbers represent indices or steps in processing rather than dimensions.

Alternatively, looking at the output tree structure: Each main part seems to branch into sub-structures with parameters like (number, number)(size). Maybe each step involves selecting a subset of elements based on certain rules and forming new branches.

Wait, another thought. The initial array might be treated as a 2D grid, and then processed by looking at each row or column for some condition that leads to splitting into sub-arrays with specific parameters.

But without knowing the exact transformation rule, it's challenging. Maybe I can look for patterns in how numbers are used:

Looking at Train Example 1:
The main array is (7x9). Then a branch with (3 (0,0)(2x6)...), another with (2 (2,0)(1x4) ... ), and the last with (1 (3,0)(3x3) ... ).

Total numbers after initial: 3 branches. Maybe it's based on how many non-zero elements are in each row or column.

Wait, but if all elements are zero initially, maybe these numbers represent something else like depth levels.

Alternatively, considering the numbers after (n x m), perhaps they're indicating counts of specific patterns.

Wait, perhaps for each initial block, we count the number of consecutive zeros and split accordingly. For example:

In Train Example 1 Input: All elements are zero except some ones in later sections.

But how does that translate to the output?

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of rows or columns processed at each step.

Wait, perhaps each number represents a step where we process certain columns based on their content. For example:

- (0,0) could mean no processing,
- (2x6) means taking 2 columns and splitting them into 6 parts,
- etc.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the sum of elements in each row or column, determining how many sub-trees to create based on that sum.

For example:

If a row has all zeros except for one '1', then we split it accordingly. But in Train Example 1, all initial arrays are zeros, so perhaps (0,0) indicates no ones and thus no splits.

Wait, but the output trees have non-zero numbers like 3,2,1 which could represent something else.

Hmm, maybe each number represents a count of sub-trees or something. But I'm not getting it.

Maybe another approach: looking at how the initial array is transformed into parts with different sizes in the output tree.

In Train Example 1:

Input matrix size: 7x9

Output has three branches:
- 2x6
- 1x4
- 3x3

Adding up to 2+1+3=6 rows, but initial is 7. Hmm, maybe it's not directly adding.

Wait, perhaps the numbers are indicating how many splits per row or column.

Alternatively, considering that (n x m) could represent n elements processed into m parts.

For example:
- 7x9 input: split into 3 branches with sizes 2x6,1x4,3x3. That doesn't add up in terms of rows.

Wait, maybe the first number after the opening parenthesis is how many sub-trees to create from that branch, and each sub-tree has a certain size defined by (n x m).

In Train Example 1:

First main branch: creates three sub-branches:
- One with 2x6
- One with 1x4
- One with 3x3

So perhaps the initial array is being split into these parts based on some rule, and each part then has its own processing.

But without knowing the exact transformation function, it's hard to say. Maybe I need to infer from the examples.

Looking at Test Example Input: (9x9)

Output:

One branch with 5x7
Another with 5x2

So, total columns would be 7+2=9, which matches the initial column count, but rows are split into two parts? Wait, no. If it's 5x7 and 5x2, that suggests processing by columns perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's about splitting each row or column based on certain criteria.

Alternatively, considering that in Test Example Input: The first branch is 5 elements tall and 7 wide, then another with 5x2. That would imply rows are split into two parts of 5 and 4? Wait, initial is 9 rows.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements in each row or column determining how many splits to make.

But I'm stuck without more information on the transformation rule.

Alternatively, perhaps this represents a kind of tree structure where each node can branch into multiple nodes with certain parameters, and these parameters dictate further processing.

In any case, it seems like for each main block (n x m), we process it by splitting into smaller blocks as per some rules defined by the numbers in parentheses. The exact rule isn't clear from the examples alone, but perhaps it's about counting non-zero elements or applying a specific transformation based on row and column counts.

So, to answer how to approach such problems: First, identify the size of the initial array. Then, determine how many branches to create (based on some criteria like number of non-zeros) and what sizes each branch will have. Repeat this process recursively until all elements are processed or according to specific stopping conditions.

But without knowing the exact rule for splitting, it's challenging. Maybe in an exam setting, more information would be provided, such as a function description or transformation rules applied at each step.
</think>

To solve such problems effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Input**: Identify the initial array dimensions and its contents.

2. **Identify Transformation Rules**: Determine how the array is processed to create branches based on criteria like non-zero elements, row/column counts, or specific transformation functions.

3. **Recursive Processing**:
   - Start with the main block.
   - Split into sub-branches according to identified rules.
   - Continue processing each branch until all elements are handled or stopping conditions are met.

4. **Analyze Examples**: Use provided examples to infer transformation rules and apply them consistently.

5. **Verify Consistency**: Ensure that splitting follows consistent patterns across different blocks.

By following this structured approach, you can systematically handle such problems and derive the correct output tree structure.
