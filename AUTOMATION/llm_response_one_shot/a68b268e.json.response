User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, so I need to figure out how the output tree was generated from the input array. The user provided an example where they input a list of zeros and then some sublists. The output is this complex tree structure with numbers, letters like (0), coordinates in brackets, sizes like 4x4, more numbers, etc.

First, I'll try to understand the input format. It looks like it's a nested array or list where each element can be another list of numbers, and some elements have these sub-sublists associated with them. The main structure seems to involve nodes labeled with numbers and letters (like 0, 4x4), which probably represent dimensions.

I think the process starts by parsing the input array into this tree-like structure. Each node must have a value, children, and possibly some size information like 9x9 or 4x4. The letters like 'A', 'B' might correspond to specific parts of the tree with their own structures.

Looking at the output example, I can see it's built recursively. Starting from the root (0), which has a value of 0 and then two children: one is another structure labeled (9x9) with its own set of nodes, and the other seems to be a list [7,8,6,1]. Each node under these must have their own values and sub-structures.

I need to break down how each part maps. For instance, 0 has two children: one is the entire (9x9) grid filled with zeros except for some patterns, and another that's a list of numbers which might represent nodes or connections between different parts.

The first child under root (0) is labeled as (9x9), so maybe this represents the main body of data. The next part within that node has sub-children like 7,8,6,1. Each of these could be individual components with their own grids and sizes.

It's also clear there are coordinates involved, like (4x3) or (5x5), which might indicate positions where specific patterns occur in the grid. The numbers following each node likely represent weights or values associated with connections between nodes.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly the parsing works from the input array to this tree structure. It seems like some kind of recursive decomposition is happening, breaking down the main list into nodes and their sub-structures until all components are represented in the output.

Maybe each number represents a node, followed by its children. The brackets with numbers inside could indicate coordinates where specific connections or weights exist between different nodes within that structure.

I need to figure out how to parse this input array correctly. Perhaps I should look for patterns: every time there's a sublist starting with a number and then some more sublists, it's another node in the tree. The numbers after each node could represent its children, which might be either other nodes or terminal nodes.

Also, sizes like 9x9, 4x4 suggest that each grid is square matrices of certain dimensions. So maybe each node represents a block within this larger structure, with specific patterns (arrays of zeros and ones) filling them in.

I should probably consider building the tree step by step:

1. Start with the root: [0, 0, 0, 0], which might be broken down into two parts based on commas.
2. Each part then gets its own structure: one is (9x9), and the other seems to have nodes labeled with letters like A(7), B(8), etc., each with their own sub-structures.

It's a bit overwhelming, but I think if I break it down into smaller parts, focusing on how each main list maps to a node in the tree, then recursively process its elements as children nodes until all structures are covered.

I also notice that some nodes have further coordinates (like 4x3) and matrices attached. These might represent sub-matrices or specific transformations applied within their parent node's grid.

To handle this correctly, I'll need to implement a parser that can identify each node type, extract its children, and recursively build the tree structure. The key is ensuring that nested structures are processed in the right order without mixing up the hierarchy.

I might also need functions to process sub-matrices or grids based on their dimensions once they're identified as part of a parent node's structure. This could involve slicing the main array according to certain indices and then further decomposing those slices into smaller nodes.

Another thing is that some parts of the tree seem to have multiple levels, like (7 (0, 0) (4x4)...), which suggests that each node can itself contain a grid or another structure. So, it's important to correctly handle nested levels and not get lost in them.

In summary, my approach would be:

- Identify main nodes from the input array.
- For each node, determine its type (whether it contains more sub-nodes or is a terminal with matrices).
- Recursively process each identified node, creating child nodes as needed based on their structure.
- Ensure that all elements are accounted for in the tree structure, maintaining the correct hierarchy.

I think practice would help here. Maybe if I try to manually parse part of the input and see how it maps to a portion of the output tree, then gradually build up my understanding from there.

Wait, another thing: some nodes have numbers attached like (7), which might be labels or identifiers for those nodes within their parent's context. These could help in routing or referencing specific parts when building connections between grids at different levels.

I need to make sure that these identifiers are correctly linked to the appropriate sub-structures so that everything nests properly in the tree.

It's also crucial to handle coordinates like (4x3) as they likely represent positions where specific transformations or weights are applied, affecting how data flows through the network represented by the tree.

Overall, this seems complex but manageable with careful step-by-step parsing and recursive processing. I'll need to write functions that can take each node's description, extract its children, process those children, and so on until all elements are mapped into the output tree structure as provided.

The output tree is generated by parsing the input array recursively, breaking it down into nodes with their respective sub-structures. Each node represents a part of the data hierarchy, often containing grids or further nodes. The tree is built starting from the root, decomposing each sublist into its components and creating nested structures until all elements are appropriately mapped.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Root Node (0):**
   - Starts with two main sublists.
   - One is a 9x9 grid of zeros except for specific patterns.
   - The other contains nodes labeled A, B, C, D.

2. **Node A (7):**
   - Represents a 4x4 grid starting at position (0,0).
   - Contains connections to other nodes like 5 and others with their own sub-structures.

3. **Node B (8):**
   - Located at (1,0) in the main grid.
   - Includes connections such as to node F(6).

4. **Node C:**
   - Starts from position (2,0), handling another set of nodes including G and H with their sub-structures.

5. **Node D (1):**
   - Located at (3,0) in the main grid.
   - Contains connections to node E(7).

6. **Recursive Parsing:**
   - Each node is processed by identifying its type, extracting children, and recursively processing those children.
   - Handles nested grids and sub-nodes appropriately.

**Final Tree Structure:**

The tree structure reflects a hierarchical decomposition of the input array into nodes with their respective grids or further sub-structures. It represents connections between different parts based on their positions and specific patterns within their parent nodes.

This structured approach ensures that each element is correctly mapped, maintaining the hierarchy and relationships required by the output format.
