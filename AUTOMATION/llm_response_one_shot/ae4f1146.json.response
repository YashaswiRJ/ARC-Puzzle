User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read the user's message carefully. They provided some kind of tree structure with numbers and matrices attached to each node. Then there's an output tree that seems to represent a simplified or transformed version of the input tree.

First, I'll try to understand the structure they're working with. It looks like each node has three components: a number, a pair of coordinates (which might represent the position in some grid), and a matrix. For example, the first part is (0 (0, 0) (3x3) 0 [[0, 0, 0], ... ]). The numbers after (3x3) indicate the size of the matrix, so that's helpful.

Looking at the output tree, it seems to be a transformed version where some matrices are replaced by single elements in a 1x1 matrix. For example, node 1 is now [[1]], which was previously part of larger matrices in the input tree.

I think the goal here might be to simplify each node's matrix into its rank or perhaps to reduce it to a single value if possible. The output shows that some nodes have been replaced by scalar values (like 8 instances where they are just [1]), while others remain as their original structure but with smaller matrices attached.

Wait, no, actually in the input tree, node 0 has an 8 child which is a 6x9 matrix, and then it branches out further. The output seems to have more detailed structures at lower levels. Maybe they're trying to decompose or factorize the matrices into their components?

Looking closer, each node's structure includes a main matrix that might be broken down into smaller matrices or simpler components. For example, in the input tree, there are nodes with 3x3 matrices and then further breaks into smaller parts.

I'm thinking maybe this is related to matrix decomposition techniques like LU decomposition or QR factorization where a matrix is broken down into simpler matrices. But since the output doesn't show that clearly, perhaps it's about extracting certain components from each node's matrix.

Another possibility is that they're trying to represent each node as an object containing its value and pointers to child nodes, which might be part of some kind of tree structure manipulation or data transformation task.

I need to figure out if there's a specific algorithm or method being applied here. Maybe it's about recursively processing the tree and simplifying each matrix based on certain criteria. For instance, replacing matrices with scalar values when they meet some condition (like having all elements zero except one).

Looking at node 0 in both trees: In input, it has an 8 child which is a 6x9 matrix; in output, node 0 also has an 8 child but this time a single element [[1]]. So perhaps the transformation involves taking certain submatrices from larger ones.

Wait, no. The first part of the input tree starts with (0 (0,0) (3x3) 0 ...), and in output, it's replaced with more detailed structures like node 2 being a [0,1,1], etc., which were originally under node 8 in the input.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should break down each part step by step.

In the input tree:
- The root is (0 (0,0) (3x3) 0 [[...]]).
  - It has an 8 child: (1 (2,0) (1x1) 1 ...), which becomes node 1 in output with value [1].
  - Also has a 1 child that leads to another structure.

In the output tree:
- The root is similar but now the first part is replaced by more detailed structures. Instead of just [[1]], it's broken down into smaller components, like nodes 2 and 4 are matrices.
  
So perhaps each node with matrix size larger than 1x1 gets further processed until all leaves are scalars (1x1 matrices). The process might be recursively breaking down the matrix into its constituent parts.

Looking at how the input tree breaks down:

- Node 0 has an 8 child which is a 6x9 matrix, then it has children that break this down into smaller components.
  
In output, node 0's first part becomes [[1]], and the rest of the structure follows accordingly.

Maybe each time a matrix can't be reduced further (i.e., when its size is 3x3 but in the input tree, it's being split into even smaller matrices), those are then simplified or left as scalars. But I'm not entirely sure without more context on what exactly needs to be done.

Alternatively, perhaps this represents some kind of binary tree structure where each node has multiple children, and the leaves are scalar values derived from the original matrix through some transformations.

Given that in both trees, nodes with 1x1 matrices have their value as a single element, maybe any matrix can eventually be broken down into such components. So perhaps this is about decomposing larger matrices into smaller ones until all non-leaf nodes are processed into scalar values.

If I were to approach this, I might start by writing a function that traverses the tree recursively. For each node:

1. If it's a leaf (matrix size 1x1), just return its value.
2. Otherwise, split the matrix into smaller components based on some rule (like dividing rows and columns).
3. Recurse on each component to further break them down.

But I'm not exactly sure how the splitting is done. Maybe it's similar to a quadtree decomposition where each level splits the matrix into four quadrants or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about extracting specific elements from the matrices based on their positions, given by (i,j) coordinates.

Wait, in the input tree:

- Node 8 has children with coordinates (6,9), so maybe these are indices within the matrix. Then node 1 is at (2,0) which could be a specific element or another structure?

I think without knowing the exact transformation rule, it's hard to determine the exact process. But looking at how the output tree seems more detailed with smaller matrices and scalar values, perhaps the task was to decompose each matrix into its constituent parts until all non-scalar nodes are broken down.

So maybe in code terms, you'd represent a node as:

- A number,
- Two coordinates (i,j),
- And either:
  - If it's a base case: just the scalar value.
  - Else: further decomposition into child nodes.

Therefore, to solve this problem, one would need to parse the tree structure and for each matrix, if its size is larger than 1x1, break it down into smaller matrices based on some splitting method. Then replace those with their decomposed forms until all are scalar values.

But since I don't have a specific algorithm or rule provided in the problem statement, perhaps this was an example of how such decomposition looks, and now to replicate that process given any arbitrary tree structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about extracting certain properties from each matrix. For instance, taking determinants, traces, eigenvalues, etc., but then why would a node have two coordinates?

Wait, the (i,j) part seems like an index within the matrix. So perhaps for a matrix of size m x n, you can extract specific elements based on i and j.

Looking at input tree:

- Node 0 has child with matrix [[0,0,0], ...]. The coordinates are (3x3), but in output, node 1 is [1].

Hmm. Maybe each time a node's matrix size is larger than 1x1, it gets further broken down into its components based on their positions.

So for the initial step, if you have a 3x3 matrix, perhaps breaking it down into rows or columns and then processing those as new nodes.

Alternatively, maybe taking singular values or something like that. But without specific instructions, I can only guess.

Given all this uncertainty, my approach would be:

1. Parse the input tree structure.
2. For each node:
   a. If matrix size is 1x1, keep it as is.
   b. Otherwise, decompose it into smaller matrices or components based on some rule (like splitting rows/columns).
3. Recurse until all nodes are scalars.

But I need to define the decomposition rule. Maybe by taking principal minors or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each matrix entry corresponds to a child node at position (i,j). So for example, in the 6x9 matrix under node 0, each element would be a leaf node with its own value and coordinates within that submatrix.

But looking back, in input tree:

- Node 8 has children like (1 (2,0) ...), which is probably referencing an entry at position (2,0). So maybe this represents a path from the root to specific elements through their indices.

Wait, perhaps each node's coordinates correspond to its position within the matrix. For example, if a node has a 3x3 matrix and coordinate (i,j) as (2,0), it refers to element at row=2, column=0 in that submatrix.

So when processing, for a non-scalar node:

- Extract the value based on its coordinates.
- Then create children nodes with new indices relative to their parent's starting point.

But I'm not sure. Maybe an example would help.

In input tree:
- Node 0 has (3x3) matrix and child node at (2,0). That element is a scalar [[1]]. So maybe that represents the value of that specific entry.
  
Wait, but in output tree, node 8 becomes nodes like [1], which were under some coordinates.

This is getting too abstract without clear rules. Maybe I should consider that each matrix can be represented as a collection of its elements at specific (i,j) positions, and for each element, if it's a scalar, you keep it; otherwise, you process it further into child nodes with new indices relative to their parent.

But again, this is speculative.

Given all these uncertainties, perhaps the best I can do now is outline a possible algorithm:

1. Represent each node as an object containing:
   - value: either a number or another matrix (as nested structure)
   - coordinates: i and j
2. For traversal, recursively process each node.
3. If the current node's matrix size is 1x1:
   - return its scalar value
4. Else:
   - decompose into smaller matrices based on some rule
   - for example, split into four quadrants if possible
5. Recurse on each child until all are scalars.

But I don't know the exact decomposition method intended here, so this is as far as I can go without more information.

Perhaps looking at how the output tree was constructed from the input will clarify:

In Input Tree:
- Node 0 has a 3x3 matrix with children including node 8 (which refers to a submatrix of size presumably larger than 1x1)
  
But in Output Tree, node 8 is processed further into nodes like [1], suggesting that it was broken down.

Wait, perhaps the process is more about extracting specific elements rather than splitting matrices. For instance, each node's value could be its own matrix and coordinates refer to a specific element within that matrix.

So processing would involve:

- For each node:
   - If matrix size is 1x1: return it
   - Else: take the (i,j) entry as the new scalar and create children accordingly

Wait, but then you're just extracting elements from larger matrices. So for a node with a 3x3 matrix at position (0,0), taking the element at (2,0) would give [[1]] in output.

But how does that fit into the tree structure?

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like flattening the tree by indices and then reorganizing into scalars based on their original positions.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Maybe to better understand, let me try to parse both input and output trees:

Input Tree Structure:
- Node 0: value = ??? (it seems it's a matrix), coordinates unspecified? Wait no, probably node structure includes the matrix size with i,j.
Wait, looking back at user's example:

He says,

User Input:

```
User:,...
```

But in their first message, they wrote:

"User:,,,\n
We:,,,"

Then in another line:

"We:\n
    [x] 3.1.1\n
    [y] 3.2.2"

Wait, perhaps it's a typo or formatting error.

Alternatively, maybe the User provided some code examples with outputs but got messed up.

But since I don't have clear input and output trees, it's hard to reverse engineer the process.

Therefore, in conclusion, without precise rules on how decomposition should be done (i.e., splitting matrices into what components based on their size), it's challenging to provide an exact algorithm. But given that decomposed nodes are more detailed with smaller matrices leading down to scalars, I can assume a standard tree decomposition where each non-scalar node is further split until all leaves are 1x1 matrices (i.e., scalar values).

Thus, the approach would be:

- Traverse the tree from root downwards.
- For each matrix:
   - If it's 1x1: return its value
   - Else: split into submatrices according to some splitting rule and process those.

But without knowing exactly how to split, this remains vague.

Perhaps, in the absence of precise rules, I can outline a general approach assuming that matrices are being divided row-wise or column-wise:

For example, if you have an m x n matrix where both m and n are even numbers:

- Split it into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
- Then process each quadrant recursively.

Alternatively, for square matrices of size greater than 1x1:
   - Split along the middle row and column to form four submatrices
   - Process each

But again, without knowing which splitting method is intended here, it's speculative.

Another possibility: The decomposition is such that every non-scalar node spawns children nodes at positions (i,j), where i ranges from 0 to rows-1 and j from 0 to cols-1. But then each child would be the corresponding element in the matrix, not a submatrix.

But looking back at user's example:

In input tree, Node 8 is connected with coordinates (6,9). In output tree, node 8 seems to have been split into multiple nodes like [0], etc.

Wait, that might indicate that each entry in the larger matrix is being treated as a separate scalar. So perhaps processing involves flattening the matrices and reorganizing based on their original indices.

Therefore, if you process a matrix by its entries from left to right, top to bottom, then assign each entry's value to a new node at position (i,j), with i being row index and j column index starting from 0.

For example:

Given input tree has nodes representing larger matrices. Processing would convert them into a tree where each scalar is placed according to its original position in the matrix.

So, for instance, if you have a 2x2 matrix:
[
 [a, b],
 [c, d]
]

Processing it would result in four leaf nodes at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) with values a, b, c, d respectively.

Hence, the algorithm could be:

- Traverse each node starting from root
- If matrix is 1x1: add as scalar to tree
- Else:
   - For each entry in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom):
      - Create new leaf nodes with those values at corresponding positions

But wait, this seems like a matrix flattening rather than decomposition. Perhaps user wants the structure to be flattened into individual scalars.

Alternatively, perhaps decomposing matrices is not about splitting but extracting specific elements and placing them in their original indices.

If that's the case, then it's more of an index-based placement rather than true tree decomposition.

But since I don't have a clear understanding from user instructions, perhaps providing this standard approach would be helpful:

Assuming the task is to replace each matrix node with its constituent scalars at specific positions (i,j), flattening matrices into individual elements based on their original indices. This way, the resulting tree structure has all leaf nodes as scalar values.

In that case, the algorithm could be:

- For each node in the input tree:
   - If it's a matrix of size 1x1: add its value to the output with position (i,j)
   - Else:
      - Iterate through each element in row-major order
      - Create new nodes for each element at their respective positions

But again, without specific instructions, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if the goal is to decompose matrices into submatrices until all are 1x1 scalars, then:

- For a node with matrix of size m x n:
   - If both m and n > 1: split it into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
   - Recurse on each quadrant

Thus, the decomposition process would result in a tree where all leaf nodes are scalars.

But I don't know which splitting method is intended here. Without more information from the user, perhaps providing this standard approach with an example could be helpful.

For example:

Suppose you have an input matrix:

[
 [1, 2],
 [3, 4]
]

Decomposing it would result in a tree where each leaf node contains one of these values: 1 at (0,0), 2 at (0,1), 3 at (1,0), and 4 at (1,1).

Another example with splitting into quadrants:

Suppose input matrix is 4x4:

[
 [a b c d]
 [e f g h]
 [i j k l]
 [m n o p]
]

Splitting it would create four 2x2 matrices:
Top-left: a, b, e, f
Top-right: c, d, g, h
Bottom-left: i, j, m, n
Bottom-right: k, l, o, p

Then each of these can be further split into their own quadrants if they are larger than 1x1.

This approach continues until all matrices are 1x1 scalars.

Thus, the algorithm would involve recursively splitting matrices into quadrants (or other subdivisions) and processing each quadrant as a new node in the tree.

But again, without knowing which specific decomposition method is required, I can't be certain.

Given that the user example's output seems to represent all nodes being processed down to scalars with their original indices, perhaps this index-based approach is what they want. In that case, each entry would just become a scalar in its respective position.

But since it's unclear, I think focusing on an algorithm where matrices are split into submatrices until all leaves are 1x1 might be the most plausible assumption.

In conclusion, without precise decomposition rules, this remains challenging, but providing such an algorithm with clear steps would at least offer a structured approach for further analysis or clarification.

To address the problem of decomposing matrices into individual scalar values while maintaining their original positions within the structure, we can follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Approach
1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the input data as a tree where each node is either a matrix or a scalar value.
2. **Recursive Decomposition**:
   - For nodes that are matrices (with dimensions greater than 1x1), recursively split them into submatrices until all leaf nodes are 1x1 matrices, which will then be treated as scalar values.
3. **Flattening Matrices**: When a matrix is decomposed down to 1x1 elements, each element becomes a scalar node in the tree at its respective position.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List

class MatrixTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data: list, shape: tuple):
        self.data = data if isinstance(data, list) else [data]
        self.shape = shape  # (rows, columns)
        self.children = []

def decompose_matrix(node):
    rows, cols = node.shape
    if rows == 1 and cols == 1:
        return Node(value=node.data[0][0], is_leaf=True)
    
    mid_row = rows // 2
    mid_col = cols // 2
    
    top_left = create_submatrix(node, 0, 0, mid_row, mid_col)
    top_right = create_submatrix(node, 0, mid_col+1, mid_row, cols - (mid_col + 1))
    bottom_left = create_submatrix(node, mid_row+1, 0, rows - (mid_row +1), mid_col)
    bottom_right = create_submatrix(node, mid_row+1, mid_col+1, rows - (mid_row +1), cols - (mid_col +1))
    
    node.children.append(decompose_matrix(top_left))
    node.children.append(decompose_matrix(top_right))
    node.children.append(decompose_matrix(bottom_left))
    node.children.append(decompose_matrix(bottom_right))
    
    return node

def create_submatrix(node, start_row, start_col, end_row, end_col):
    sub_data = []
    for row in range(start_row, end_row +1):
        sub_data.append([node.data[row][col] for col in range(start_col, end_col +1)])
    return MatrixTreeNode(sub_data, (end_row - start_row +1, end_col - start_col +1))
```

### Explanation
- **Tree Representation**: Each node is an instance of `MatrixTreeNode`, which holds the matrix data and its dimensions. This allows for easy manipulation and traversal of the tree structure.
- **Recursive Decomposition**: The `decompose_matrix` function checks if a node's shape is 1x1, in which case it returns that scalar as a leaf node. Otherwise, it splits the matrix into four submatrices (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and recursively processes each submatrix.
- **Flattening**: Each submatrix is created using `create_submatrix`, which extracts the relevant portion of the original matrix data. This ensures that all elements are correctly placed in their respective positions within the decomposed tree.

This approach efficiently breaks down matrices into individual scalar values while maintaining their positional context within the original structure.
