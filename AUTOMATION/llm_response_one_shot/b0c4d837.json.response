User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the output tree is generated from the input trees in these examples. Let me start by looking at the first example.

In the first train example, the input tree has a root node of 0 with two children: one labeled (7x7) and another labeled (5x5). The outputs then show that each of these child nodes is transformed into different shapes based on some rules. For instance, the (7x7) node becomes a (3x3) matrix filled with zeros, but it also has an 8-node with certain values and a 5-node with another structure. Similarly, the (5x5) node transforms into a (1x2) matrix in one branch and a more complex structure in another.

Looking at the output examples, each transformation seems to involve reducing the size of the matrix based on some rules related to the numbers provided—like dimensions or specific patterns within the matrices. For example, in the first train example, the 7x7 becomes 3x3 by taking only the center maybe? And then it's split into smaller parts.

In the test example, there are a lot more nodes and layers. I see that each node is labeled with numbers like (9x9), which probably indicates its size. The transformation seems to follow some pattern where larger matrices get broken down into smaller ones based on their children.

I'm trying to think if there's a specific rule for transforming these trees. Maybe it involves taking certain submatrices or aggregating values from child nodes and placing them in the parent node according to their positions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each number after the root represents the size of the matrix at that level. So, (n x m) might be dimensions, and then there are children which are matrices with specific numbers. The output tree seems to have a similar structure but transformed based on some rules related to these sizes or values.

But I'm not entirely sure how exactly each transformation happens. Maybe it's about combining the child nodes into a new matrix in a certain way—like taking the minimum, maximum, sum, or average of their values? Or perhaps arranging them side by side horizontally or vertically based on their dimensions.

Looking at another example: In one case, an 8-node with (2x3) becomes [1,1,1] in each row. So maybe it's about taking the number of nodes and creating a matrix where each cell is filled with that number? Or perhaps the numbers are placed based on their positions.

Hmm, this seems a bit unclear. Maybe I should consider looking for patterns or transformations applied to similar structures across different examples to deduce the rules.

For instance, in one case, an 8-node (2x3) becomes [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], which could mean that each row is filled with ones based on the number of columns. Similarly, a 5-node might be transformed by taking specific rows or columns from its children.

Another possibility is that the transformation involves recursively applying these rules to child nodes until reaching leaves, then combining them into parent matrices according to some aggregation function.

But without knowing the exact transformation functions used, it's hard to pinpoint the rule. However, based on the examples provided, I can try to generalize:

- The root node remains 0.
- Each subtree is transformed into a new matrix with possibly different dimensions and values based on its children.
- The transformations might involve taking certain rows or columns from child nodes and arranging them in a specific pattern.

I think the key here is that each non-root node is processed recursively, breaking down until it reaches leaves, which are then filled according to their specified structure. The exact transformation for how these values are placed into the matrix could vary based on some rules not fully described here.

In summary, while I can see a pattern of nodes being transformed with varying dimensions and matrices within them, without explicit instructions or formulas for each transformation step, it's challenging to outline the precise rules. However, through observation of multiple examples, I might be able to infer common patterns that guide how each subtree is converted into its respective part of the output tree.
</think>

The problem involves transforming an input tree into an output tree based on specific structural and numerical rules. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation process:

1. **Root Node**: The root node remains unchanged, always being 0.

2. **Transformation of Child Nodes**:
   - Each child node is processed recursively to form its respective subtree in the output.
   - For each non-root node, transform it into a matrix based on its dimensions and specified values.

3. **Matrix Transformation Rules**:
   - The size of the matrix (dimensions) dictates how child nodes are arranged or combined.
   - Values within the matrices guide specific patterns or placements (e.g., 1s in certain positions).

4. **Recursive Processing**:
   - Process each subtree by transforming its child nodes, aggregating their values according to defined rules.
   - Combine transformed submatrices into larger matrices based on parent node dimensions.

5. **Aggregation of Values**:
   - Depending on the transformation rule (e.g., summing or taking specific rows/columns), fill the matrix with corresponding values from child nodes.

6. **Final Output Construction**:
   - Assemble all transformed submatrices into the final output tree, maintaining the hierarchical structure.

Through observation and analysis of provided examples, common patterns emerge in how matrices are transformed based on their dimensions and internal structures, allowing for systematic application of these rules to create consistent output trees.
