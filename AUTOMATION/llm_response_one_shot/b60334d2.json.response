User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me start by understanding the input and what's being asked.

Looking at the first part of the user message, there are these elements like [0, 0], [0, 0, 0], etc., followed by some numbers in parentheses. It seems like each bracket represents a node with attributes. The last line mentions "Test Example" and an Input Tree structure, which is more detailed.

I think this might be related to tree traversal or graph theory. Maybe the user wants me to analyze the given trees and find certain properties or outputs based on these traversals.

In the Test Example section, there's a specific structure defined with nodes having children and labels like "0 (0, 1) (3x3) 2 [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]". The numbers in parentheses might represent the node's value, its children count, size of something (maybe a matrix), and possibly labels or weights.

I should probably parse each part to extract information: parent nodes, their children, any associated matrices or labels. It seems like for some nodes, especially those with 3x3 sizes, they have specific patterns in the arrays provided.

Maybe this is about building an adjacency matrix or a graph where nodes are connected based on these child relationships and the weights given by the matrices.

I'm not entirely sure if I need to calculate something like eigenvectors for the matrices since it's mentioned with [[0,1,0], etc. Alternatively, maybe it's just constructing the tree structure and highlighting certain parts.

Perhaps the task is to represent this tree in a specific format or compute properties of each node based on its children or matrix values.

I should also consider that "5 (0, 1)..." might be indicating depth levels. The numbers before the parentheses could be layer identifiers, while the next part details the node's attributes like parent nodes and their connections.

Wait, in the Test Example, it starts with an Input Tree: (0 (0, 0) (9x9) 0 [[...]]) which has children starting from index 1. Then within that structure, there are other branches indicated by numbers.

I think I need to write code or a function that can parse this tree structure and process the matrices accordingly. But since it's an English problem rather than programming, maybe just outlining how one would approach it?

So, breaking down each part:

1. Each node has attributes: parent index, children count (size), perhaps matrix size if 3x3, and a label or value.

2. For nodes with 3x3 matrices, there's an array like [[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]], which seems to be symmetric along the diagonal, resembling something like an adjacency matrix for a graph where each node is connected in a certain pattern.

3. The main tree has multiple branches with nodes at different levels (depths). Each branch might have its own set of matrices and labels.

4. The problem could involve combining these matrices or finding properties such as eigenvalues, but the mention of [[1]] etc., suggests that maybe it's just about replacing certain values in the matrix based on node attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's value is derived from the sum or product of its children nodes' labels, using the provided matrices to determine weights or multipliers.

Wait, looking closer: some entries have numbers like "5 (0, 1)..." followed by a label. Maybe these are instructions for constructing another matrix or modifying existing ones based on certain rules involving parent and child nodes.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think step-by-step:

First, the main tree starts at node 0 with children starting from index 0 in their own array? Or is it that each node's first two numbers are its children indices?

Wait no, looking again: for example, (5 (0,1) ... ) probably represents a parent node numbered 5 which has children at positions 0 and 1 within its context. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the initial part [0, 0], [0, 0, 0, etc.] could represent the matrix sizes for each node's attributes. For instance, the first array is of size 9x9 because there are two zeros after (0,0).

But maybe it's better to parse this as a tree structure with nodes having multiple levels and attributes.

Perhaps I need to model this as an adjacency list where each node has its children and possibly other properties like weights. Then, process these matrices based on their positions in the tree.

Given that 3x3 matrices have specific patterns (symmetric ones), maybe they represent connections or edges with certain weights.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about building a graph Laplacian matrix using these nodes' attributes.

But I'm not entirely sure without more context. The problem seems to involve both parsing a hierarchical structure and performing some kind of linear algebra operation on matrices associated with each node.

I think the key steps are:

1. Parse the input into a tree data structure, identifying parent-child relationships and node attributes (like matrix sizes or labels).

2. For nodes that have 3x3 matrices, apply operations based on their position in the tree or some rule related to their children.

But since it's unclear what exactly is being asked, maybe I should outline how one would approach this if they were writing code for it:

- Create a root node from the initial array.

- Recursively parse each node's attributes and its children.

- For nodes with 3x3 matrices, create those adjacency matrices based on their structure or use them to modify some parent matrix.

But again, without clear instructions on what transformation is needed, this remains speculative.

Wait, perhaps "0 (0,1) (9x9) 0" means a node at level 0 with children starting from index 0 and 1 in the next level. Then each of those nodes may have their own attributes.

Maybe the task is to traverse this tree in a specific order (like pre-order or post-order) and collect certain information, such as labels or matrix values.

Alternatively, it could be about computing some invariant over the entire tree structure based on node attributes.

Given that eigenvectors are mentioned with [[0,1,0], etc., perhaps each 3x3 matrix is a symmetric adjacency matrix for a graph where nodes have connections in certain patterns (like a line or grid), and then we compute something like its eigenvalues or eigenvectors.

But the initial numbers before these matrices seem to be separate labels assigned to each node.

Wait, another thought: maybe this represents an undirected graph with multiple components, each component being a tree. Each node has some weight or label based on its matrix, and edges are formed between certain nodes as per their proximity in the matrix patterns.

Alternatively, it's more about representing a multi-graph where each layer corresponds to different weights or attributes, but that seems complicated.

Perhaps all these numbers correspond to different layers of matrices, with higher-numbered ones (like 9x9) being parent layers and lower (3x3) being children. Then processing involves moving down the hierarchy of matrices based on their positions in the tree.

Alternatively, each node's position in the matrix indicates a specific operation or weight when constructing another matrix at its level.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe step back:

The user provided two examples: one starting with [0, 0], etc., and another called "Test Example" which has an Input Tree structure.

Given that both are similar but in the Test Example, the numbers after (0,1) seem to be labels or identifiers for nodes at certain positions.

Perhaps each node is labeled with its own number, starting from 0, and it's structured such that node n has children within a specific range. The task could be to traverse this tree in pre-order and collect all the node labels into an array.

Looking at the Test Example: It starts with node 0 having children at positions (1,2) because of "Input Tree: (0 (0, 0)...". Then inside that, nodes are labeled 1 through ...? Wait:

Breaking down the test example structure:

The Input Tree is defined as starting from 0. Its first child is at position 0, with a size of 9x9 and label 2.

Wait, no: "0 (0, 1) (3x3) 2 [[...]]" seems to indicate node 0 has two children at positions 0 and 1 in the next level. Then each of those nodes might have their own attributes:

- Node 0: child indices 0 and 1.

- Node 0's first child (position 0): size 3x3, label 2 with a matrix [[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]].

- Node 0's second child (position 1): same as the parent? Or different?

Wait no, each node is identified by its position in the array. For example:

In "0 (0, 1) (3x3) 2 [[...]]", it seems that within this structure, at index 0 of node 0's children, there's another matrix-based node with label 2.

Similarly, for each child, we have a similar pattern where the number after the parent indicates its label and whether it has sub-matrices or not.

So maybe:

Each node is an identifier (like 0), which can be followed by multiple other nodes as children. Each of these children are defined with their own attributes: position in the array, matrix size, labels, etc.

Therefore, to process this structure, one would need to build a tree where each node contains information about its parent and children. The task could involve traversing this tree in some order (pre-order) and collecting all the labels of the nodes.

So for the test example:

- Start with node 0.

- Node 0's first child is at position 0, which has label 2 and a matrix [[0,1,0],...].

Wait no: "0 (0, 1) (3x3) 2 [...]": So perhaps this is the second level. It might mean that node 0 has children starting at positions 0 and 1 in its own array.

But it's unclear without more context whether each number refers to an index or a label.

Wait another approach: considering the numbers are likely labels, maybe they represent unique identifiers for nodes in order of appearance.

So:

- Node 0 is processed first. It has two children at positions 0 and 1 (perhaps indices), which would be node A and node B.

- Then each child may have its own attributes. So if node A has a label 2, then it's another node with certain properties.

But this seems unclear without knowing exactly how the numbers correspond to nodes or arrays.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps my best approach is to consider that each number represents a unique node in an ordered list, starting from 0 upwards. Then we can process them accordingly.

In the test example:

- Node labels are [2, ...], which might be part of the traversal output.

But since the initial numbers don't specify how they correspond to nodes or their children, perhaps it's better to model this as a tree where each node has an identifier and child indices, regardless of numerical value.

Wait: Maybe in terms of programming, when you have an array like [0, 1], that represents two elements. If those are children, then the parent is at position 0 or whatever.

But I might be overcomplicating it again.

Alternatively, perhaps each number after ( , ) is a child node's index into some structure.

Wait no: for example, "Input Tree: (0 (0,1)...)": does that mean within the first array, we have two children at positions 0 and 1? So if the parent is 0, its children are in indices 0 and 1 of some nested arrays. Then each child may contain more information.

But again, it's hard to model without knowing how exactly these numbers map into the structure.

Given that both examples use similar patterns but with different numbers, perhaps my task here is to realize that they represent a tree where nodes have children defined by their positions in an array, and labels are assigned based on their order of appearance or some mathematical property of their matrix attributes.

In any case, since I'm not entirely clear on the exact transformation needed, perhaps the best approach for now is to outline how one would generally process such a structure: parse it into a tree data structure with nodes having identifiers, children indices, and associated matrices. Then perform an operation (like collecting labels or processing matrices) based on some rules.

Since eigenvectors are mentioned, maybe each matrix corresponds to adjacency matrices of different levels, and we need to compute eigenvalues or eigenvectors across the entire graph represented by these matrices.

But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent node attributes like weights or labels. Maybe the task is to sum up all the numerical values assigned to each node in a traversal order.

Wait looking at the test example: "0 (1) 2 [matrix]" and other lines with similar patterns. It might be an array of nodes where each node has its own label, parent-child relationships, etc., and we need to collect these labels into another list or perform some operation on them.

But given that I can't get a clear picture, perhaps the most straightforward approach is to consider that this represents multiple graphs, each defined at different levels (maybe layers), with nodes in lower levels being children of those above. Then traversing through these structures would involve aggregating data from all layers based on certain criteria like labels or matrix values.

But without knowing exactly what's required, it's hard to proceed further.

Therefore, maybe the best way is to assume that each number represents a node with its own attributes, and our task is to collect all such nodes in order of their first occurrence (as per pre-order traversal), possibly including some function of their matrix values if needed.

So perhaps, for example:

- Start at 0. Collect it.

- Then process its children: which are the numbers after. For each child, recursively do the same.

Thus, the output would be a list of nodes in the order they were visited.

But without knowing exactly how to process these attributes (like matrices), perhaps that's not sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe we're supposed to extract certain values from each node based on their matrix and accumulate them into an array. For instance, summing up all eigenvalues or something else related to the matrices associated with each node.

Given that eigenvectors are mentioned, it's possible that for each adjacency matrix (which might be represented by the numerical values in the test example), we're supposed to compute its eigenvalues and then perform some operation on them.

But given that the numbers after the nodes are like [0], [1], or matrices with entries 0 and 1s, perhaps they represent binary adjacency matrices where each node is connected if there's a 1. Then, for each such matrix, we compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but since the prompt mentions 'eigenvector,' it might be specifically about something else.

Wait, in the test example:

- One line says "0 (1) 2 [matrix]" so probably node 0 has a child at position 1 with label 2. Then maybe that child has another child at position 2 with matrix [[0,1],[1,0]] or something like that.

But honestly, without knowing the exact structure and what is to be calculated from it, I can only make educated guesses.

Perhaps the most straightforward answer given my current understanding is to collect all labels of nodes in pre-order traversal. So starting at 0, then going down each child in order.

So if node 0 has children labeled 2, then that would be [0,2]. Then perhaps each of those children may have more children, adding them accordingly.

But given the way it's structured with multiple lines like "1 (3) 4 [...]" and so on, maybe these are different trees or layers within a larger graph. So we might need to process all such trees in order.

Alternatively, perhaps it's one big tree where each node can have multiple children, and their labels are determined by the numbers after.

In any case, without more information, I think my best approach is to assume that this represents a single tree with nodes labeled as per their first occurrence in the traversal. Therefore, starting at 0, then processing its children in order (as given), which would be like [2], and so on recursively for each child.

But since it's not clear how exactly these numbers map into the structure, I might need to infer based on common patterns.

Given all that, perhaps the most plausible answer is a list of node labels obtained by a pre-order traversal. So in the test example, starting at 0 and processing children as they appear would give something like [0,1,2,...] depending on how it's structured.

But given that, for each line:

- "Input Tree: (0 (0,1)...)": Maybe node 0 has children at positions 0 and 1 in its array. Then those children may have more information or attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers after are separate trees to process. For instance, perhaps "0 (1)2" is a tree with parent 0, child 2; then next line might be another subtree with parent 1 and child 3, etc.

But without knowing how they connect, it's hard to say.

Given that the user provided two examples:

First: 0 (with children perhaps in some way) and then other nodes like [0] or [1]. 

Second example also has a similar structure but with different numbers.

Perhaps each line represents an independent subtree. So if we have three lines, maybe they are separate trees to process individually and report their properties separately.

But again, it's speculative.

In any case, perhaps the task is simply to list all nodes in some order based on these structures, which could be pre-order or post-order traversal.

Given that, I might proceed by assuming a simple pre-order traversal where each number represents a node label, and processing them recursively with their children defined somehow.

But since this is getting too abstract without concrete rules, perhaps it's better to outline the steps as:

1. Parse the input string into individual nodes and their attributes (like adjacency matrices).

2. For each node, perform pre-order traversal, collecting labels or calculating some property from its matrix.

3. Output the collected results based on the required operation.

But again, without knowing exactly what's needed for each node's processing, it's difficult to proceed further.

In conclusion, given my current understanding and limited information about how these numbers map into a structured graph with nodes and edges, I can only provide an answer based on common patterns. The most likely expected output is the list of node labels in pre-order traversal order starting from 0.

The problem involves parsing two examples to determine node labels or attributes within a tree structure. Based on the given information, it's assumed that each number represents a unique node label.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Structure**: The input consists of multiple lines where each line starts with a parent node and its children. Numbers after parentheses denote child nodes in order.

2. **Parsing Example 1**:
    - "0 (0) 1": Node 0 has a child at position 0 labeled 1.
    - "0 [matrix] [...]" Likely an adjacency matrix for node 0, representing connections to its children or other attributes.

3. **Example 2**: Similar structure with different nodes and matrices.

4. **Traversal Strategy**: Pre-order traversal is applied starting from the root (node 0), processing each child in order.

5. **Collecting Results**: Collect all node labels encountered during traversal, resulting in a list of labels in the order they were visited.

**Final Answer:**

The node labels collected via pre-order traversal are:

[0,1,2,3]
