User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, I'm looking at this problem here. It seems to involve some kind of matrices or grids based on the notation provided. There's a bunch of zeros and then a series of numbers with letters like (2 (6, 8) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ). Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to parse this. The initial part is a list of lists filled with zeros. It looks like a grid or matrix. There are multiple 2D arrays here, each containing just zeros and ones in some patterns. I'm guessing this could be related to something like cellular automata or maybe even game theory, where cells have states represented by numbers.

Then, after the zeros, there's a series of tuples with numbers: (2 (6,8) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ), (3 (6,17)... and so on. Each tuple seems to follow a pattern: a number, then two coordinates in parentheses, another number indicating size, followed by more numbers which include the next number and some brackets with ones.

Let me try to make sense of this step by step.

Starting with the first one: (2 (6,8) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ). Maybe this is saying that at position (6,8), there's a cell with value 2, which is surrounded by a 1x1 area. The next part, 2 [[1]], seems to indicate the next step or something.

Similarly, the second tuple: (3 (6,17) (1x1) 3 [[1]] ). So position (6,17) has value 3, same as before.

This pattern repeats with different coordinates and values. Then towards the end, I see a more complex structure like (8 (3,4) (4x4) 1 [...]). Here, it's at (3,4), size 4x4, and then some matrix inside the brackets.

I think each of these tuples might be representing a rule or transformation applied to a specific cell in the grid. The numbers before the coordinates could be steps or generations, and the values after indicate the state changes based on neighboring cells.

Maybe this is similar to Conway's Game of Life, where each cell's next state depends on its current state and the number of live neighbors. But instead of just 0s and 1s, these have numbers like 2, 3, etc., which might represent different states or something more complex.

The part in the brackets with [[1]] suggests that this is a single cell turned on or updated to value 1. The matrices inside, like [[1,1,1], [0,1,0]], are probably showing how neighboring cells influence each other.

I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. Maybe these tuples are instructions for generating the grid step by step, where each tuple tells you to update a specific cell based on some rule involving its neighbors in that area.

Alternatively, it could be representing a transition matrix or something used in linear algebra to transform the state of the grid over time.

Another thought: perhaps this is part of a larger algorithm for solving a puzzle or simulating some kind of cellular behavior. The numbers and coordinates might map out paths or specific operations to perform on certain parts of the grid.

I'm feeling a bit stuck, but I think focusing on each tuple individually could help. Each one seems to have the format: (number) (coordinates) (size) (value/next number) [[matrix]]. Maybe breaking them down:

1. The first number is like an identifier for something.
2. The coordinates point to where in the grid this applies.
3. The size tells you how big the neighborhood or area around that cell is.
4. The next number and matrix indicate what happens after, perhaps setting the value of that cell.

For example, (2 (6,8) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ) might mean at position (6,8), in a 1x1 area, set the cell to 2 based on some rule which results in just [1]. Maybe it's simplifying or transforming that value.

But without knowing exactly what each part represents, it's hard to be precise. I think the key is recognizing the pattern and figuring out if this notation corresponds to a known system or algorithm. It could also be specific to a particular field like graph theory or computer graphics.

I wonder if there's a standard notation for representing grid-based cellular automata or state transitions that resembles this. Maybe something similar to how matrices are used in linear transformations, but applied spatially on a grid.

Also, the presence of multiple 0s grids suggests perhaps layers or states being updated simultaneously based on these rules.

I should probably look up if there's any standard format like this for representing cellular automata or state transitions. Maybe it's similar to how chess positions are represented with algebraic notation but applied to a grid system.

In summary, I think each tuple represents an operation on a specific cell in the grid based on its position and surrounding cells' states. The numbers before the coordinates could be step counts or identifiers, and the matrices inside might define the rules for updating the cell's value. Without more context, it's challenging to decode exactly how each part interacts, but breaking them down individually might provide some clues.

The problem involves interpreting a series of tuples that represent operations on a grid, potentially used in cellular automata or state transitions. Each tuple likely specifies an operation at a particular cell, with coordinates indicating location and matrices defining the transformation rules. The exact interpretation would depend on further context, such as whether it's similar to known systems like Conway's Game of Life or linear algebra transformations.

**Answer:**

The given tuples represent operations on a grid where each tuple specifies how a cell's value is updated based on its position and surrounding cells' states. Each tuple includes coordinates (e.g., (6,8)), the size of the area (e.g., 1x1), and a matrix that defines the rule for updating the cell's value. The numbers before the coordinates likely indicate step counts or identifiers, while the subsequent values and matrices outline the transformation rules applied to update the grid.

The exact implementation would require understanding the specific rules each tuple represents, which could be similar to cellular automata transformations or linear algebra operations on a grid.
