User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to understand this problem. It looks like it's about some kind of tree structure with arrays and nodes. The user provided a test example input tree which is pretty complex with multiple levels and sub-branches. My goal is probably to process this tree in some way—maybe traverse it or perform an operation on it.

First, I need to parse the input format. It seems like each node has three main components: a left child, a right child (or maybe just one child since there's only 0 and something else), and then a value which is either another array or some numbers in parentheses. The output tree structure follows a similar pattern.

Looking at the test example input:
(0 (0, 0) (14x13) 0 [[...]])

I can see that it starts with a node labeled 0, which has children both 0 and something else. Then there's another part inside this main node where it refers to (3 (1,2) (6x6) ...), indicating another nested structure.

Perhaps the task is to represent this tree in a specific format or compute some property of the nodes based on their positions and values. The user also provided an output example which seems to reflect how these structures are built recursively.

I think I need to write a function that can parse such input strings into a structured format, maybe as nested dictionaries or lists, where each node contains its children and value information. Then, depending on what the problem requires—like calculating some property of the tree—I could perform operations like counting nodes, summing values, etc.

Another approach is to think about traversing the tree in order (pre-order, post-order) and processing each node according to its structure. Each node's children might correspond to parts of an array, so maybe reconstructing the arrays from the tree structure would be necessary.

I also notice that in the first example, there are 0s which seem to represent empty nodes or placeholders. So perhaps zeros have specific meanings based on their position and context within the tree.

Given that the test example has multiple levels of nesting with different dimensions (like 14x13, 6x6, 2x2), I'm guessing each level corresponds to a sub-array in some way, which might be used for data processing like image resizing or matrix transformations. The fact that there are specific numbers attached to nodes suggests that they could represent values at certain positions within these arrays.

I need to figure out how the children relate to their parent node's value and dimensions. Maybe each child corresponds to a part of the array, divided based on some criteria—like splitting into quadrants or rows/columns.

To break it down:
1. Parse the input string into its constituent nodes.
2. For each node, extract information about its left/right children and its value (the array).
3. Recursively build a data structure representing the tree.
4. Depending on the problem's requirements, process this structure—maybe evaluate some function over all elements or traverse it in a certain order.

I'm not entirely sure what the exact task is because the user didn't specify, but given that they provided an input and output example, perhaps the goal is to represent the tree correctly based on the parsing rules of their custom format.

One thing I can do is try to write code that parses this string into a nested list structure. Each node would be represented as something like [value, left_child, right_child], where value could be an array or specific integers indicating dimensions and values.

Alternatively, if it's easier, perhaps each node can be converted into a tuple containing its type (like 'node', 'array'), its children, and other properties. Then, functions can be applied recursively on this structure.

I also need to handle the fact that some nodes have multiple levels of arrays within them—so for example, in the first test case, after the initial 0 node with two children, there's another nested array representing a larger matrix which itself contains more nodes.

Another challenge is correctly handling multi-digit numbers and distinguishing between different components. The strings can be quite long with varying lengths, so I'll need to parse them accurately without misinterpreting parts of one component as another.

Let me try to outline the steps:
1. Split the input string into its components.
2. Iterate through each part to identify nodes, their children, and values.
3. For each node, process its left and right children recursively.
4. Once all nodes are parsed, construct a tree structure that can be easily manipulated.

I also wonder if this is related to Huffman coding or some kind of binary tree where nodes have specific encoding rules. The presence of multiple levels suggests it's more about hierarchical data rather than binary trees with weights.

Additionally, the numbers like (6 (8,4) (1x1)) might represent dimensions and possibly values at each node. It could be that 1x1 refers to a single element array or something similar.

Maybe I can think of each node as having:
- A value which is an array
- Left child node
- Right child node

But the initial examples show that sometimes there are multiple elements, like [[...], [...]], indicating two children. So perhaps nodes have exactly two children until they reach leaf nodes or some condition.

This makes me think of a binary tree where each non-leaf node has exactly two children: left and right.

Given all this, my approach would be to parse the string into such a structure using recursion for building the tree.

I should also consider error handling—what if the input format is incorrect? But since I don't have information on that, maybe it's beyond the current scope. The user provided valid examples, so perhaps we can assume correct input.

To summarize:
- The task involves parsing a complex string into a tree structure with nodes containing arrays and child nodes.
- Each node has specific properties: value (array), left child, right child.
- Recursive parsing is likely needed to handle nested structures correctly.
- Once parsed, the tree can be processed for various operations based on requirements.

I think I'll start by writing code that splits the string into tokens representing each part of a node. Then, process these tokens recursively to build the tree structure. Each time I encounter a node definition, I extract its left and right children (if any) and its value as an array or dimension information.
</think>

The problem involves parsing a complex input string into a structured tree format where each node contains specific properties such as its left and right children, a value which could be an array or dimensions, and possibly other attributes. The goal is to represent this structure correctly for further processing.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Parsing the Input String**:
   - Split the input string into components that represent individual nodes and their respective properties.
   - Identify each node by its label (e.g., 0) and extract information about its children and value.

2. **Recursive Parsing**:
   - Use a recursive function to parse each node, handling nested structures appropriately.
   - For each node, process its left and right children if they exist, ensuring that the tree is built correctly at every level.

3. **Constructing the Tree Structure**:
   - Represent each node as a dictionary or list containing its properties: value (which could be an array of dimensions), left child reference, and right child reference.
   - Handle cases where nodes might not have children by setting appropriate placeholders (e.g., `None`).

4. **Handling Dimensions and Values**:
   - Extract numerical values from the string to represent dimensions or specific elements within arrays.
   - Ensure that multi-digit numbers are correctly parsed without misinterpreting parts of other components.

5. **Building the Final Tree**:
   - Once all nodes are parsed, construct a nested structure where each node encapsulates its children and value information in a hierarchical manner.

6. **Output or Further Processing**:
   - The final tree can be used for various operations such as traversal, evaluation of specific properties, or conversion into other formats like arrays for data processing.

By following these steps, the input string is transformed into a structured format that accurately represents the nested nodes and their relationships, facilitating further analysis or manipulation based on the problem's requirements.
