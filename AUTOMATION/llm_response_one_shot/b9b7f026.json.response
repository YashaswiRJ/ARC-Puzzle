User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this array of numbers here. It looks like it's a list inside another list multiple times. Let me try to make sense of it step by step.

First, the user presented an array with several sub-arrays. Each of these seems to be filled with zeros initially:

[
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  ...
]

I count how many of these zero-filled sub-arrays there are. It seems like each group has 8 zeros, and then there's another array with more zeros after that. Hmm, actually, looking closer, all the entries before the first part I see have multiple zeros.

Then, suddenly, the numbers change to non-zero values in a specific pattern:

5 (8,1) (3x3) 4 [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]

Okay, so this indicates that at position (8,1), there's a 3x3 sub-array where each element is 1. But wait, how does the numbering work here? Is it row-major or column-major?

Looking further down:

7 (11,10) (3x4) 6 [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]

So at position (11,10), there's a 3x4 sub-array with some zeros in the middle. Interesting.

Then another:

4 (6,9) (4x4) 3 [[all ones]]

And so on. It seems like each number is associated with coordinates and the size of the sub-array where certain values are placed.

I think the user might be referring to a grid or matrix where specific blocks have been replaced with 1s and some other numbers, but mostly zeros except for those defined positions.

But then I see that after all these descriptions, there's another array:

(2 (1,0) (6x8) 2 [[1,...]]) 

Which indicates at position (1,0), a 6x8 sub-array with all ones. Wait, but earlier it was mostly zeros except for some specific blocks.

This is confusing because initially, the user presented an array filled with multiple zeros and then later described positions with non-zero values. Maybe this represents a grid where most cells are zero, but certain regions have been set to one or other numbers based on coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps these arrays represent something else, like image data where each sub-array is a pixel channel or some feature.

But stepping back, I need to figure out what the user is asking. They provided an array of zeros and then defined positions with specific values in brackets. Maybe they're trying to create a sparse matrix or define regions within a larger grid that have certain properties?

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's related to image processing where each sub-array represents a pixel region filled with ones except for some areas.

Alternatively, maybe this is about defining masks or binary matrices where certain positions are marked as 1s and others remain 0.

Wait, looking at the structure:

First, multiple zeros. Then specific blocks of ones in different sizes: 3x3, 3x4, 4x4, etc., with varying numbers of ones.

I think this could be related to creating a binary mask where certain regions are active (1) and others are inactive (0). The coordinates mentioned might be the positions within this larger grid where these sub-arrays are placed.

So perhaps the user is trying to build such a mask or matrix by specifying these blocks of ones at given coordinates. Each block has its size determined by the first numbers in parentheses, like 3x3, and then how many 1s it contains.

But why would they have multiple zeros initially? Maybe because this is part of a larger image or grid where most pixels are zero except for these defined regions.

Alternatively, maybe each sub-array represents different layers or channels. For example, in RGB images, you have three layers (red, green, blue), but here it's more about having multiple binary matrices with ones at specific positions.

Wait, looking again:

The initial array is filled with zeros and then later replaced by blocks of 1s. So perhaps the entire grid is mostly zero except for these defined regions where there are blocks of 1s.

But why would they have that structure? Maybe it's a way to represent different features or segments within the grid, each segment being a block of ones with specific dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe this is part of an adjacency matrix or connectivity matrix in graph theory, where edges (connections) are represented by ones and non-edges by zeros. But here, only certain parts have edges defined as 1s at particular coordinates.

But then why the sub-arrays? Maybe it's a multi-dimensional array where each dimension represents a different feature or coordinate.

Wait, perhaps this is for defining layers in a 3D grid. For example, x, y, z coordinates with each layer representing a different z-coordinate and within that layer being filled with ones at specific (x,y) positions.

But I'm getting speculative here without more context.

Alternatively, maybe these are coordinates in a sparse matrix where most elements are zero except for certain indices which have 1s. But again, the structure is unclear.

Wait, looking back:

They first have an array of zeros with multiple entries. Then suddenly define specific positions with non-zero values and block sizes.

So perhaps it's like defining a grid where each cell can be either part of a zero region or a sub-array with 1s at specified coordinates.

But the way they presented it is confusing because initially, all are zeros except for these defined blocks which have numbers before them. It might not make much sense unless this structure has a specific meaning in their field.

Alternatively, maybe each number refers to an index in some data structure where you define certain regions with 1s at given positions.

I'm starting to think that without additional context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what they're trying to do. But perhaps I can attempt to model this as a grid where most cells are zero except for specific sub-arrays defined by coordinates and sizes filled with ones.

Alternatively, if this is about image segmentation or something similar, defining regions of interest (ROI) within an image which is mostly zeros (background) but has certain regions marked as 1s (ROIs).

Wait, perhaps the initial arrays are just part of a larger structure where each sub-array represents different properties or layers. For example:

- The first set could represent x-coordinates.

- Then y-coordinates.

But I'm not sure how that would translate without more info.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like NumPy array indexing where multiple dimensions are defined with specific values filled in certain regions.

Wait, if we consider each of these blocks as slices within a larger 3D array. For example:

- The first sub-array is the main grid.

- Then at position (8,1), you have a 3x3 slice filled with ones.

But then I'm not sure how that connects to later numbers like 7(11,10) etc.

Alternatively, maybe it's about defining specific points in a grid where each point has certain properties. For example:

- At (8,1), set all the surrounding cells within a 3x3 area to 1.

But why would they have multiple zeros before that? Maybe those are background values, and then they are setting certain regions as active or 1s.

Wait, maybe this is about creating a grid where each coordinate has a value assigned based on some function. For example:

- At (8,1), assign all surrounding cells to be 1 in a 3x3 area.

But again, without knowing the context, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps these are matrices for different channels or layers, and they're defining regions where certain layers have ones.

Wait, another thought: maybe each of those numbers represents something else. The first number after ( might be an identifier, then inside is coordinates, then size, then number of 1s.

So like:

5 (8,1) (3x3) 4 [[...]] 

This could mean that at position (8,1), there's a 3x3 sub-array with four ones. But in the array provided, it's all ones: [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each number represents how many 1s are placed in that specific region. So:

5 (8,1) (3x3) 4: at position (8,1), a 3x3 area has four 1s and the rest zeros?

But wait, their array is all ones.

Wait, maybe I need to parse it differently. The initial user input was multiple zero arrays, then numbers with descriptions:

5 (8,1) (3x3) 4 [[...]]

So perhaps this indicates that in a grid where most are zero, at position (8,1), we have a 3x3 block filled with four ones.

But the array provided has all ones. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's just an example of how to structure such data.

Wait, but the numbers after each bracket don't seem consistent. The first is 5 followed by 4 ones in a 3x3 area.

Then next:

7 (11,10) (3x4) 6 [[...]]

So at position (11,10), a 3x4 sub-array with six ones.

But the array they provided has five ones? Wait: [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]] which is:

Row 1: four ones

Row 2: two ones and two zeros

Row 3: four ones

Total ones: 4 + 2 + 4 = 10. But they mention six.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Let me count the second example:

[[1,1,1,1], [1,0,0,1], [1,1,1,1]]

Row 1: four ones

Row 2: two ones (first and last)

Row 3: four ones

Total: 4 + 2 + 4 = 10. But the user wrote "six". Maybe they miscalculated.

Similarly, in the first example:

[[1,1,1], [1,1,1], [1,1,1]] has nine ones, but number mentioned is four.

So perhaps that initial structure is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what each part represents.

Alternatively, maybe each of these blocks is being described by their position and the size, then how many 1s are there. But in reality, it's either all zeros except for some regions set to ones or something else.

Wait, perhaps this is about creating a grid where at certain coordinates, specific sub-arrays with certain sizes have values assigned as ones based on some criteria.

But without more context, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants help in parsing how such data structures are formed. So for example, if you have multiple zero arrays and then define regions within them to set certain blocks to 1s at specific coordinates.

So perhaps they want guidance on how to structure this kind of grid with zeros as background and mark specific sub-arrays as ones based on given positions.

If that's the case, maybe I can explain it as:

To create a grid where most cells are zero (background), but certain regions marked by coordinates have 1s. Each region is defined by its starting position, size (number of rows and columns), and how many 1s are within that region.

For example, at coordinate (8,1), we define a 3x3 sub-array where all cells are set to 1. Similarly, at (11,10), a 3x4 sub-array is defined with some ones based on the given array.

But again, without knowing exactly what they want to do or if these arrays represent something else, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps this is related to NumPy indexing where multiple slices are being assigned values. For example:

- They have a main grid of zeros.

- Then they assign specific sub-regions with ones based on given coordinates and sizes.

But again, without more context or precise instructions, it's hard to know exactly what they need help with.

So maybe I can suggest that they clarify their objective or provide more details about the structure they're working with. That way, I can assist them better in setting up such grids or arrays as per their needs.

To create a grid where most cells are zero (background), but certain regions marked by coordinates have 1s, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Main Grid**: Start by creating a 2D array filled with zeros. This will serve as your background.

2. **Identify Regions to Mark**: Determine the specific sub-arrays that need to be set to 1 based on given coordinates and sizes.

3. **Assign Values to Regions**: For each identified region, update the corresponding cells in the main grid to 1.

For example, using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a background grid of zeros with shape (rows, cols)
main_grid = np.zeros((total_rows, total_cols))

# Define regions and set them to 1
# Example region: start at (8, 1), size 3x3
start_row = 8
start_col = 1
rows = 3
cols = 3

main_grid[start_row:start_row+rows, start_col:start_col+cols] = 1

# Another example region: start at (11, 10), size 3x4
start_row2 = 11
start_col2 = 10
rows2 = 3
cols2 = 4

main_grid[start_row2:start_row2+rows2, start_col2:start_col2+cols2] = 1
```

This will create a grid where the specified regions are marked as 1, and the rest remain zeros.
