User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this input tree in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out what it represents. Let's break it down step by step because honestly, the notation is a bit confusing at first glance.

First, looking at the structure, it starts with (0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[... ]]). Okay, so that seems like a node with some children. The numbers after each parenthesis probably represent different parameters: maybe the number of children, their types or something else? Hmm.

The first part inside the parentheses is (0 (0, 0)). That might mean it has two children, both of type 0. Then comes (10x10), which could be dimensions or matrix sizes—maybe a 10x10 grid? And then another 0, followed by a list of arrays: [[0,0,...], [0,0,...], etc.].

Wait, the next part is (5 (7,4) (3x5) 1 [[...]]). Hmm, so here it's saying node 5 has two children with types 7 and 4. The (3x5) might indicate some kind of structure—maybe a 3-row by 5-column matrix? Then there's another parameter 1 and an array inside.

Then comes (2 (8,5) (1x3) 4 [[...]]). So node 2 has two children with types 8 and 5. The (1x3) could be a small grid again, perhaps a row vector? Then another set of parameters: 4 and an array.

Another section is (5 (1,1) (5x6) 1 [[...]]). Node 5 has two children with types 1 and 1. The (5x6) is probably a larger grid—5 rows by 6 columns—and then another parameter 1 followed by arrays.

Then there's (2 (2,2) (3x4) 2 [[...]])]. So node 2 here has two children with types 2 and 2. The (3x4) is maybe a medium grid—3 rows by 4 columns—and then another parameter 2 followed by arrays.

This seems to be some kind of tree structure where each node can have multiple children, and these children are defined in terms of other parameters like their own dimensions or grids. It's quite complex with nested parentheses. I'm not exactly sure what this represents but it might be part of a larger system for matrices or data organization.

Let me try to visualize the structure based on the notation:

- The main node is 0, which has two children (maybe at level 1). One child is another node labeled 5 with some parameters and its own children. The other child seems to have parameters like 2, 8, 5, etc.

Breaking it down more systematically might help. Let's parse each part step by step:

1. First main node: (0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[long array]]). So this is a level 0 node with two children of type 0, which are probably leaves or something.

2. The first child of the main node is (5 (7,4) (3x5) 1 [[another array]]). So node 5 has two children: one with parameters 7 and 4, another possibly with nothing specified?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps each pair inside a parenthesis represents a parent node's properties—like the number of children, their types, dimensions, etc.

Alternatively, this could be part of an expression tree where numbers represent operations or nodes, and the rest are their parameters.

Another thought: Maybe these are defining shapes for tensors in PyTorch or something similar. Tensors have shapes like (batch_size, channels, height, width), but here it's using a different notation with grids and sizes.

Alternatively, this could be related to graph theory, where each node has certain edges or connections defined by the numbers after the parentheses. It's hard to tell without more context.

Given that the user mentioned "Test Example" in their input, maybe they're looking for some specific output based on this structure—like converting it into an image, array, or something else.

Wait, I also notice arrays with mostly 0s and a few 1s. That might suggest binary matrices or activation patterns in neural networks. Like, if each node represents a layer where certain neurons are active (1) and others aren't (0).

But the presence of numbers like 3x5, 8x5 seems more like matrix dimensions—maybe these are transformations between layers? So starting from a 10x10 input, going through various operations or convolutions that reduce or change the size.

So putting it all together:

- The main node processes a 10x10 input.
- It splits into two parts: one goes to a 3x5 grid (maybe after some max pooling or convolution), and another remains as 8x5? Or perhaps it's undergoing different transformations in each branch.

Wait, but the first child is 5 with parameters (7,4) on a 3x5 grid. Maybe this node does something like taking those dimensions and further reducing them to 2x2 or similar? Hmm, not sure.

This structure seems to have multiple layers of processing—maybe each set of parentheses defines a layer in the network, where nodes transform data from one shape to another based on their children's parameters.

Perhaps it's akin to a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture where you have different filter sizes and pooling operations at various levels. The numbers could represent kernel sizes or strides.

For example:

- Input is 10x10.
- First layer: splits into two paths, one with a 3x5 grid after some operation, another with an 8x5 grid? Not sure why there are two outputs from one node—maybe it's combining them?

Wait, in the main node, first child is (5...), second is (2...). So maybe the main node has children 5 and 2.

Then child 5 has its own children: 7,4 on a 3x5 grid with parameter 1. Then perhaps another operation? Maybe it's combining multiple transformations?

It's getting too vague without knowing the exact context or domain this notation is used in. But given that there are arrays of 0s and 1s, maybe it's about binary masks or inclusion/exclusion in a graph.

Alternatively, these numbers could be counts—like node 5 has two children of types 7 and 4? Not sure what type they are—maybe layers with certain neuron counts?

Given that I can't recall the exact meaning without more context, my best approach is to map out the structure as clearly as possible. Each main node seems to branch into smaller nodes, each defining their own operations based on parameters.

If I try to visualize it:

- Level 0: Node 0
  - Child 5
  - Child 2

Level 1:
- Node 5:
  - Child 7 (maybe)
  - Child 4 (maybe)

- Node 2:
  - Child 8?
  - Child 5?

Wait, the numbers in parentheses could be node IDs or types. So each opening parenthesis starts a new node with its parameters.

Perhaps this is defining a graph where edges are defined by these nodes' connections? But I'm still not clear on how exactly it maps.

Another approach: Since there are multiple grids mentioned (10x10, 3x5, 8x5, etc.), maybe this represents a pooling or downsampling operation in each layer. For example:

- Starting from 10x10
- Then after processing, get two outputs: one is 3x5 and another is 8x5?
Wait, that seems inconsistent because typically you'd expect a single output shape.

Alternatively, maybe the main node processes data in both paths—so first path becomes 3x5, second becomes 8x5. Then each of those goes through their own processing.

But I don't have enough info to be sure.

Given all this confusion and lack of context, my best guess is that this represents a tree structure where each node processes data from its parent according to some parameters (like grid sizes) and passes it along to children nodes. The numbers in parentheses might specify how the data is transformed at each step—like filter size, stride, or other operations.

Perhaps someone familiar with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow would recognize these as defining layers within a neural network. Each node could represent an operation (like Conv2d) that processes inputs of certain dimensions and outputs to new dimensions based on kernel sizes or pooling window sizes.

For example:
- The main input is 10x10
- Node 5 applies some operation with kernel size 7,4? Or maybe stride?
Wait, but the parameters are given as numbers without clear meaning—maybe it's width and height?

Alternatively, these could be tensor shapes. If a node has children with certain dimensions, perhaps they represent sub-layers or different processing branches.

Another angle: The presence of multiple layers (e.g., 5(7,4), then within that another layer) suggests some form of deep learning architecture where data is passed through several transformations before reaching the final output. Each transformation could be a linear layer, pooling, activation function, etc.

Given all these possibilities, it's hard to pin down exactly what this represents without more context or documentation on the specific notation used. But I can say that it defines a hierarchical structure with nodes and their operations, likely part of some computational graph for processing data—perhaps in machine learning or computer vision.

If pushed further, maybe each node is like a function that takes input tensors of certain sizes and applies transformations (like matrix multiplications or convolutions) to produce outputs of different sizes. The numbers correspond to the dimensions of these tensors at various stages.

So overall, while I can't provide an exact interpretation without more information, it's safe to say that this represents a tree-like structure defining data flow through a series of processing operations, each modifying the size or type of the data based on defined parameters.
</think>

The provided notation describes a hierarchical or tree-like structure where nodes represent operations or functions applied to data. Each node processes input data according to specific parameters (like grid sizes) and passes it along to child nodes for further processing. This likely represents a computational graph, such as in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, where each node could correspond to an operation transforming tensor dimensions through convolutional layers or other transformations.

The structure starts with a main input of size 10x10 and processes data through multiple layers (e.g., nodes 5, 2) that may involve convolutions or pooling operations. Each node's parameters specify how the data is transformed at each step, potentially altering dimensions based on kernel sizes or other operation-specific settings.

In summary, this notation defines a deep learning architecture where data flows through several processing stages, with each stage modifying tensor dimensions according to defined rules, likely part of a neural network structure such as a convolutional neural network (CNN).
