User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, let's see what this problem is about. I'm looking at the input example provided. It seems like it's a nested structure with multiple levels and some numbers attached to each part. Maybe it's representing something hierarchical or layered.

First, I notice that there are these tuples inside parentheses, each starting with a number followed by another set of numbers in brackets. For example, (5 (7, 4) (4x4) ...). Hmm, the structure is a bit confusing at first glance. Let me try to parse it step by step.

Starting from the top, there's an input tree represented as:
(0 (0, 0) (12x12) 0 [[...]] ...)

I think each of these tuples represents some kind of configuration or layer, with numbers indicating parameters like counts or dimensions. The first number is probably the main value, followed by sub-values in parentheses.

Looking at the next part: (5 (4, 8) (3x3) 2 [[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]) ...). So maybe each tuple has a structure like:
(main_number, parameter_set, dimensions, another_number, matrix or grid)

I'm thinking this might be related to some kind of data structure where you have layers with specific configurations and grids within them. Maybe it's for visualizing something like a neural network layer, where each node is connected in a certain way.

The first tuple after 0 is (5 (4,8) (3x3) 2 [[...]]). Breaking this down:
- Main number: 5
- Parameter set: (4,8)
- Dimensions: 3x3 grid
- Another number: 2
- Matrix with elements mostly 1s and a 0 in the center

Then another tuple inside it is (7 (8,5) (2x2) 4 [[1,1], [1,1]]).

Finally, within that there's another tuple: (5 (1,1) (5x5) 1 [[1,1,1,1,1], ...]) and then inside it a (8 (2,2) (3x3) 2 [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]] )

Wait, maybe each of these is representing nodes in a graph or network. The numbers could be node counts or connections. The matrices might represent weights between nodes.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's about convolutional neural networks where layers have certain filter sizes and depths. Let me think: in CNNs, you have input size, filter size, number of filters, etc.

Looking at the first tuple again:
(5 (4,8) (3x3) 2 [[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]])

If this is a layer, maybe it's saying that there are 5 main nodes or features. Each has some connections defined by the parameter set (4,8), and within each node, there's a 3x3 grid of weights represented by the matrix with mostly 1s except the center.

Similarly, inside that, another tuple for a layer: (7 (8,5) (2x2) 4 [[1,1], [1,1]]). So this could be an intermediate layer with more nodes or different filter sizes.

The innermost layers are smaller grids. Maybe they're building up to some kind of feature map in the network.

Wait, but all these numbers and structures are inside each other. Is there a pattern here? The outermost tuple has 0, then within it another structure that goes down to more detailed configurations.

Perhaps this is representing a tree-like structure where each node branches into sub-nodes with their own parameters. So starting from the root (the main input), each branch defines how it's divided or connected further.

But without knowing the exact application context, it's hard to be certain. Maybe if I think of these as nodes in a computational graph, each tuple represents a node that has inputs and outputs based on its parameters.

Another angle: these could represent layers with specific activation functions or connections. The matrices might indicate which nodes are connected where—like 1s for active connections and 0s for inactive ones.

Wait, looking at the innermost matrix:
[[1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0,1],
 [1,0,0,0,1],
 [1,0,0,0,1],
 [1,1,1,1,1]]

This looks like a cross shape. Maybe it's defining how data flows from one layer to another—perhaps in an image processing context where edges are detected.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact meaning without more information. It might help if I look for patterns or recurring elements.

The first tuple has (5, 7) as main numbers with sub-structures, then nested within that (8,2), and so on. Maybe these represent multiple layers in a network where each layer's configuration depends on the previous one.

Alternatively, it could be representing some kind of decision tree or state machine where each level branches into sub-steps with specific parameters.

I'm also noticing that many of the parameter sets are (4,8), (2,5), etc. Maybe these represent pairs like input size and number of filters in a convolutional layer?

But considering the matrices have 1s and 0s, it's more likely to be connection patterns rather than filter weights.

Maybe each tuple defines how nodes connect within their layer, with the matrix indicating which connections are active.

Wait, if I consider this as a graph structure, each main number could represent a node count. The sub-tuples might define edges or child nodes.

But again, without knowing the exact domain, it's challenging to be precise. Perhaps it's time to make an educated guess based on common structures.

Given that there are nested tuples with grids of 1s and 0s, I think this is probably representing a binary connection matrix at each layer, where 1 indicates a connection and 0 indicates none.

So starting from the top:

- The main layer has 5 nodes.
- Each node connects to several sub-nodes based on (4,8), which might be input size and number of outputs or something similar.
- Within that structure, there's another layer with 7 nodes, each connecting to a smaller grid.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe if I think about it as defining the depth and width of a neural network:

1. The first tuple: main layer with some configuration leading into sub-layers.
2. Each subsequent tuple defines how that layer connects to another, possibly deeper in the structure.
3. The innermost layers might be the final output or deepest features.

Alternatively, it could represent an entire computational graph where each node (number) is a function with inputs and outputs defined by its parameters and connections.

Wait, considering all these nested tuples, maybe this represents multiple levels of computation where each level uses the outputs of the previous one as inputs. So starting from 0, you go through layers defined by these tuples until you reach the final result or output.

But again, without knowing the exact context, it's hard to be accurate. I think I've reached my limit in trying to parse this structure.

Maybe if I look at how many times each number appears: 5,7,8,2 are used multiple times. It might indicate that there are different layers with these node counts or connection sizes.

Alternatively, the numbers like (4,8) could be dimensions of some tensors or arrays in a data processing pipeline.

But perhaps I should consider this as a representation of nodes and their connections:

- The first tuple has 5 main nodes.
- Each of these connects to sub-nodes based on (4,8), which might mean each node is connected to 4 inputs and produces 8 outputs or something like that.
- Then within those, another layer with 7 nodes, each connecting to a 2x2 grid.

But the grids are matrices filled with mostly 1s except some 0s. Maybe these indicate activation patterns—like only certain connections are active based on the matrix values.

Alternatively, maybe these matrices represent adjacency lists where 1 means connected and 0 not connected.

Wait, if you have a graph structure, each node can be represented by an adjacency matrix. So perhaps within each layer, nodes are defined by their connections as per these binary matrices.

But then why are there multiple numbers like (5,7) associated with each tuple?

I think without more context, it's difficult to interpret precisely. Maybe I should consider that this is a representation of layers in a graph or neural network where:

- Each main number represents the number of nodes in a layer.
- The sub-tuples define how these nodes connect to other layers, possibly through dimensions and matrices.

For example:
(5 (4,8) (3x3) 2 [[1's matrix]]) could mean a layer with 5 nodes, each connected via a 4-dimensional input and an 8-dimensional output using a 3x3 grid of weights. The inner number 2 might represent the number of filters or connections between layers.

Then inside that, another tuple defines how this layer connects to another with (7 nodes), which uses (8,5) parameters, also through a 2x2 grid.

But I'm not certain if the matrices are part of each node's configuration or just once at the end. Maybe it's a series of layers where each subsequent one builds on the previous, using specific connections defined by these grids.

In any case, without more information about what this structure is meant to represent (like whether it's a graph, neural network, state machine, etc.), my analysis remains limited.

Perhaps I should take another approach: looking at how many nested tuples there are. There are four levels:

1. The main tuple: probably the highest layer.
2. Then one inside with 7 nodes.
3. Then another with 8 and so on.
4. The innermost layers have grids.

This might indicate a hierarchical structure where each level depends on the previous, leading down to specific connections or outputs defined by these grids.

Alternatively, it could represent multiple independent subgraphs within a larger network, each defined by their own tuple.

But since there are numbers repeating like 5 and 7 in different contexts, maybe they refer to different parts of a system with varying configurations.

I think I've exhausted my possibilities without further context. My best guess is that this structure represents layers in some kind of graph or neural network where each layer has nodes connected via these matrices, but the exact interpretation would depend on knowing the domain.
</think>

The structure you're describing appears to represent a hierarchical or layered system, possibly within a graph or neural network framework. Here's a breakdown based on the analysis:

1. **Top-Level Structure**: The main tuple likely represents a high-level layer with nodes defined by parameters like (4,8), suggesting connections and outputs.
2. **Sub-Layers**: Each nested tuple defines subsequent layers, such as 7 nodes connecting via matrices, indicating deeper dependencies or connections within the structure.
3. **Connection Matrices**: Binary matrices of mostly 1s indicate active connections between nodes in each layer, possibly defining how information flows from one layer to another.

In essence, this could represent a network where each layer's configuration and node connections are defined progressively, leading to specific outputs or features based on these defined relationships. Without further context, the exact application (like a neural network) is inferred but not certain.
