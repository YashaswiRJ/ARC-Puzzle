User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this user query here. It's a block of data that seems to be structured with multiple lists inside brackets and some numbers following each bracket. The structure is a bit complex with parentheses and numbers attached to them. My first thought is that this might be related to error-correcting codes, specifically something called a BCH code or perhaps a cyclic code since I remember those being represented with similar notations in coding theory.

Let me break it down step by step. The user has provided several lines, each starting with an opening parenthesis and containing numbers inside. Each line seems to represent different parameters for a code. For example, the first part is (4 (21,7) (6x14) 13 ...). I recognize that in coding theory, (n, k) refers to the length and dimension of a code, so n=21 and k=7 here. The "6x14" probably indicates the size or dimensions related to another aspect, maybe the number of information bits times something else.

Looking at the subsequent parts: each line has numbers following after parentheses which might represent different parameters like the number of codewords or specific weights in the code. For instance, 21 is often a length parameter for codes with nice properties, and 7 is also common as it's one less than 8, which is a power of two, hinting at binary codes.

Then I see numbers after each set like "6x14" - maybe this refers to the number of parity check matrices or something related. The last part has 13 [[ ... ]] with more sets inside, each starting with numbers and then another structure. These inner brackets have zeros and ones, which are typical in binary codes.

Given that BCH codes often use generator polynomials based on roots, their parameters can be determined by the designed distance, length, etc. The fact that there are multiple (4 ... ) sections could indicate different code constructions or subcodes within a larger code structure.

The user is probably asking for an explanation of these parameters or assistance in constructing such codes. They might need help understanding what each number represents or how to generate similar code structures. It's also possible they're encountering this while working on a project involving coding theory, cryptography, or data transmission where error detection and correction are crucial.

I should consider the possibility that the user is not just presenting raw data but has an underlying question about BCH codes or finite fields since these parameters often relate to them. Maybe they want help in computing the generator matrix for such codes given specific lengths and designed distances or perhaps they're trying to understand how these codes are structured based on their parameters.

Additionally, I notice that some lines have different dimensions inside the innermost brackets. For example, one line has 6x14, another with 7x14, then 9x14, etc., up to 13x14. This might suggest a progression or layers within each code structure. The numbers like 21 and 13 could be the lengths of the codes, while the others are likely dimensions or other specific parameters.

I also recall that in BCH codes, the length is often chosen as one less than a power of two for simplicity, so n=2^m -1. Here, n=21 isn't exactly like that, but maybe it's another code with similar properties. Alternatively, 21 could be part of a cyclic code.

Moreover, looking at the innermost brackets filled with ones and zeros makes me think these are parity-check matrices or generator matrices for specific codes. Each row likely represents an equation in the code's construction, ensuring that each codeword satisfies certain parity conditions to detect and correct errors.

Given all this, my next step is to figure out what exactly the user needs help with. Are they looking for an explanation of these parameters? Or maybe assistance in constructing such codes from scratch? Alternatively, perhaps they're trying to decode a message using these codes but got stuck on understanding how it's structured.

Since I don't have direct communication with the user beyond this text, I need to infer based on their input. It might be helpful to provide an overview of BCH codes and explain how parameters like (n, k) are used in constructing them, along with some examples using similar numbers as given. Alternatively, if it's about a specific code they're trying to build, explaining the process step-by-step would be beneficial.

Another angle is that these might represent generator matrices where each block corresponds to different codes or interleaved codes for better error correction. The multiple layers (each starting with 4 ...) could indicate different levels of redundancy added for fault tolerance in distributed systems, which sometimes use such layered code structures.

In summary, my thought process involves recognizing the structure as BCH or cyclic codes due to the numerical parameters and binary matrices within brackets. Each line's numbers likely represent key parameters like length, dimension, designed distance, and maybe even specific weights of codewords or subcodes. The innermost brackets probably contain generator or parity-check matrices that define how codewords are constructed.

Therefore, I should prepare an explanation starting with identifying the type of code based on the parameters, explaining each part of the structure, perhaps providing examples of similar codes, and then diving into specific aspects like the meaning of each number in their context. If there's a deeper question about decoding or construction from these parameters, addressing that would be the next step.

I should also consider whether the user is working with finite fields since BCH codes are typically defined over such fields, but without more context, it's hard to tell. It might be helpful to mention how field properties relate to code design here.

It seems like you've provided a block of data that appears to be related to coding theory, possibly representing parameters for error-correcting codes, specifically BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenhem) codes or similar cyclic codes. Let me break down the structure and explain each part:

1. **General Structure**: The code is represented as a series of parameters grouped within parentheses, with numbers following them that likely represent key attributes such as length, dimension, designed distance, number of parity checks, etc.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `(4 (21,7) (6x14) 13 ...)`: This indicates a code with parameters (n=21, k=7), where `n` is the length and `k` is the dimension.
   - The number following each set of parentheses could represent additional attributes like the number of parity checks or other specific properties.

3. **Inner Brackets**: The innermost brackets contain a matrix-like structure filled with zeros (`0`) and ones (`1`). These likely represent generator matrices or parity-check matrices for specific codes, which are crucial in defining how codewords are constructed.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - `(6x14)`: This might indicate the number of information bits multiplied by a certain factor (e.g., 6 input bits resulting in 14 total bits).
   - The numbers following each line, like `13 [[ ... ]]`, could represent specific weights or distances within the code.

5. **Code Construction**: BCH codes are typically constructed based on their designed distance, length, and number of parity checks. Each parameter set likely corresponds to a different code with varying levels of redundancy and error-correcting capability.

6. **Decoding Implications**: The structure suggests that each code is built from multiple layers or subcodes (as indicated by the `4 ...` groups), which could imply interleaving for better fault tolerance in data transmission systems.

To summarize, this appears to be a detailed representation of several BCH codes with specific parameters and generator matrices. Each number and matrix block corresponds to a code designed for error correction, with multiple layers or subcodes providing redundancy and improved reliability.
