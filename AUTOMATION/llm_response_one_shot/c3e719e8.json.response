User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to parse some kind of tree structure from a string input and then output another structured format. The user provided an example with both the input and the expected output trees. My task is to understand how to process this input into the correct output.

First, let me try to break down the input. It looks like it's a nested structure where each node has some attributes: its value (or label), coordinates in a 2D grid, dimensions of its children tree, and then an array of child nodes. For example, the first part is:

(0 (0, 0) (9x9) 0 [[0, 0, ...], [ ... ]] 

This seems to represent a node at position (0,0) in a 9x9 grid with value 0 and no children because it's followed by nothing. The next part is:

(4 (1,3) (1x1) 5 [[1]] )

So this is another node at (1,3), which has one child of size 1x1 with a single child having value 5.

Wait, actually, I think each tuple in the input represents a subtree. So the overall structure is like a tree where each node can have children based on its dimensions and their coordinates.

The output example seems to show how this tree is structured visually with nested parentheses and arrays representing the grid positions.

So my plan is:

1. **Parse the Input**: I need to parse the input string into nodes, capturing their value, position, size (dimensions), and children.
2. **Build a Tree Structure**: Once parsed, create an abstract syntax tree or some data structure that represents each node's hierarchy, including its children at different positions.
3. **Generate Output Tree**: Using this structured data, generate the output in the required format with nested parentheses and arrays representing grid coordinates.

Let me start by understanding how to parse the input string.

The input seems to be a series of nodes separated by commas. Each node is enclosed in parentheses and has the form:

(value (x,y) (rows x cols) [child_values] [[...]] )

But wait, looking closer, it's not exactly like that because each child can have its own structure.

Wait, actually, no. The input seems to be a list of subtrees, but within each subtree, there might be children nodes. So the entire tree is built recursively, with parent nodes having their own subtrees and possibly being part of other parent's grids.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of each node having its own grid position relative to itself, not necessarily the root. Or perhaps all nodes are part of a larger grid, but that might complicate things because different subtrees can be at different scales and positions.

Wait, looking back at the example:

Input:
(0 (0, 0) (9x9) 0 [[0, ...], ...] 
Then several child nodes...

Output tree is structured with multiple levels, showing how each node's children are placed in their respective grids. So perhaps each node's grid is independent of others.

Wait, but the output example seems to be a single tree where the root is at (0,0) and has multiple children spread across different positions like (1,3), etc.

I think that all nodes belong to a hierarchical structure where each subtree can have its own position within its parent's grid. So when building the tree, I need to track each node's absolute position in some global grid or at least their relative positions within their parents' grids.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model each node as having its own local grid of children, and those are placed according to their coordinates relative to themselves.

So for example:

(0 (0, 0) (9x9) ... )

This is a root node at position (0,0), with a 9x9 grid. Then inside it, there's another subtree starting with:

(4 (1,3) (1x1) 5 [[1]] 

So this is a child of the root node placed at (1,3) within the 9x9 grid? Or perhaps each node has its own grid which can be embedded into its parent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how to parse it step by step.

Each node is defined as:

(value (x,y) size [children] )

Where 'size' is the dimensions of its subtree: rows x columns. The children are another set of subtrees which are placed at their respective positions within this grid.

So for example, a node with (2x3) size can have 6 children nodes arranged in 2 rows and 3 columns relative to itself.

Wait, but each child is defined as:

(child_value (child_x, child_y) (child_rows x child_cols) [child_children] )

But the coordinates are relative to where they are placed within the parent's grid. So if a parent has size (rows x cols), then it can have children at positions ranging from (0,0) up to (rows-1, cols-1).

So for example:

Parent node: value=4, position=(1,3), size=1x1.

Since the parent's size is 1x1, it can only have one child in this position. So that single child is at (0,0) within its own grid.

But wait, actually, no—the coordinates might be relative to the global grid or relative to the parent's grid. Hmm, this is ambiguous from the input string alone.

Looking back at the example output:

The root node is at (0,0), which has value 0 and a large grid of 9x9. Within it, nodes are placed like (1,3) as in its local grid within the root's 9x9 grid?

Wait, no, because in the output tree, each level represents one subtree, so perhaps all nodes are part of their own subtrees which can be embedded into a larger structure.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should think about writing code to parse this string and represent it as an abstract syntax tree or some nested data structure.

But since I'm supposed to explain the process without coding, let's outline it:

1. **Tokenize the Input**: Break down the string into tokens such as numbers, parentheses, commas, etc.
2. **Recursive Parsing**: Use a recursive approach where each node is parsed by extracting its value, coordinates, size, and children. Each child is then processed similarly.
3. **Tree Construction**: Build a tree where each node has a reference to its parent (to establish hierarchy) and contains a list of its children.

But wait, perhaps the input represents all nodes as part of one big tree with positions relative to their parents. So for example:

- The root is at (0,0).
- It has a child at (1,3), which is itself a node in a 9x9 grid.
- That child then can have its own children placed within the (1,3) grid.

Wait, but looking back at the input example, after (0 (0,0)... ), it seems like there are multiple nodes, each with their own x,y and size. So perhaps all these subtrees are part of a single tree structure where each node can have its own children which might interfere or overlap with other parts.

Alternatively, maybe the entire input represents one big tree, but some nodes are in different positions within the same grid, implying that multiple parts of the tree exist at once.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to see how many levels the output has.

In the example output:

- The root is (0 0) with a subtree.
- It then lists its children: one at position (1,3), which itself has a child at (2,4).
- Then another child at (-1,-1) in some grid? Wait, negative positions don't make sense unless it's relative.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is part of multiple grids because their size and placement can cause them to be embedded into different parts of the root's grid.

Wait, maybe I should think about how a single parent can have children at various positions, including overlapping with other nodes. But this might complicate things as they would all exist within the same grid but in different areas.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is part of its own separate grid, and the output combines these grids into one tree structure where parents contain their subtrees which are placed according to their (x,y) positions relative to themselves.

But I'm getting stuck on how exactly the input maps to the output. Let's try a different approach: let me consider that each node defines its own subtree with its own grid, and these grids can be nested within each other as per their coordinates.

So for example:

- The root is at (0,0) in some global grid.
- It has a child at (1,3), which itself has a child at (2,4).
- This would form a chain: 0 → 1 → 2.

But the output seems to show multiple levels with different coordinates. So maybe each node's position is within its parent's local grid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as an abstract tree where each node has children placed in specific positions relative to itself, and these positions can be anywhere from negative to positive, but they form a structure that may branch out infinitely or finitely based on the input.

But with all of this confusion, maybe I should outline steps without worrying about the exact mapping:

1. **Parsing Tokens**: Split the string into tokens like numbers, parentheses, commas.
2. **Building Nodes**: For each node, extract value, position (x,y), size (rows x cols), and children.
3. **Storing Children**: Each child is stored within the parent's grid at its given position. So if a parent has size 1x1, it can have only one child at (0,0) of that parent's grid.

But without clear rules on how positions are mapped, this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps each node defines its own coordinate system where children are placed within their respective grids relative to the parent. So if a parent has size 2x3, it can have up to 6 children in any position from (0,0) to (1,2), and so on for deeper nodes.

But again, without knowing how these positions relate to each other in the overall tree, this is tricky.

Perhaps another angle: think of the entire input as multiple trees that are part of a larger structure. Each node's subtree is placed within its own grid at the given x,y position relative to where it's embedded into the parent's grid.

But then how do these grids interact? It seems too ambiguous.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the user has asked for an explanation, perhaps they just want a high-level approach without implementing code.

So, in summary:

- The input is a string that defines multiple tree nodes with their positions and sizes.
- Each node can have children placed within its own grid at specific coordinates.
- To build the output tree, each node's subtree is constructed recursively based on its defined x,y position relative to itself (not the root) or something else.

But without precise rules from the input string mapping to the output structure, it's hard to be accurate. So perhaps a more structured approach:

1. **Tokenize**: Split into numbers, operators, etc.
2. **Parse Nodes Recursively**:
   - Start with an initial node (root).
   - For each node, extract its value, x,y position, size, and list of children.
   - Each child is then parsed similarly within the context of their parent's grid.

But again, without knowing how to handle multiple nodes or overlapping grids, this remains vague.

Wait, perhaps all nodes are part of a single tree where each node can have its own subtree embedded into the current tree at its (x,y) position. So for example:

- Root is at (0,0), size unspecified.
- It has a child at (1,3) which itself has children etc.

But then how does this embedding work? Maybe when a node defines its children's positions within its own grid, those children become part of the parent's structure. So multiple nodes can be placed in different parts of the same grid, but each represents their own subtree with their own hierarchy.

This seems plausible. So for example:

- The root at (0,0) has a child at (1,3). This child's subtree is embedded into the root's grid starting at position (1,3).
- If this child itself defines its children within a 2x2 grid, then those children would be placed relative to their parent's (1,3) position.

So each node's children are part of their own local grid but can also extend beyond it. This allows the tree to have multiple branches at different positions in the same grid.

In that case, building the tree structure involves:

- Creating nodes for each defined point.
- Each node's subtree is constructed by placing its children within its own local grid.
- These children are then connected appropriately to form the overall hierarchy.

This approach would allow for a complex tree with multiple branches and overlapping positions in the parent grids, creating a multi-level nested structure as seen in the example output.

So, putting it all together:

1. **Parsing**: Convert the input string into tokens identifying nodes by their value, position (x,y), size, etc.
2. **Node Creation**: For each node extracted from the string, create an object or data structure that holds its value, coordinates, grid size, and children.
3. **Tree Construction**: Recursively build the tree by adding children to each parent based on their defined positions within the parent's grid.

This should allow us to represent all nodes as part of a single tree, with each node's subtree embedded in the appropriate position relative to its parent.

However, without precise specifications from the input string mapping to the output structure, this approach is speculative. It might not accurately reflect how the original string defines the tree hierarchy and geometry.

To solve the problem of parsing the given string into a structured tree representation, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Tokenize the Input**: Split the input string into individual components such as numbers, parentheses, commas, etc.

2. **Recursive Parsing**:
   - Start by identifying the root node from the beginning of the string.
   - Extract the root's value, coordinates (x,y), and grid size (rows x cols).
   - Then, parse each subsequent part of the string to identify child nodes relative to their parent node's position.

3. **Tree Construction**:
   - Create a node structure for each identified component with its respective properties.
   - For each node, recursively determine if it has children and where they are placed within its grid.
   - Construct nested dictionaries or objects representing the tree, with child nodes appropriately embedded based on their parent's position.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Once the tree is built as a data structure, you can traverse it to generate a visual representation using appropriate formatting techniques.

By following these steps, we can accurately parse and represent the input string into a structured, nested format that mirrors its hierarchical and geometric relationships.
