User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Okay, so I have this list of lists here: [ [1,1,1,1], [1,1,...] ] and there's a bunch more after that. Then there are these operations mentioned like (1 (2,6) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ) followed by similar ones. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what all this means yet, but I'll try to break it down.

First, looking at the initial list of lists. They seem to be arrays with mostly 1s and some 0s. The first few have eight elements, then there are longer ones towards the end. Maybe these represent something like a grid or matrix in programming terms? Or perhaps they're part of a puzzle where I need to find certain patterns?

Now, looking at the operations mentioned after: (1 (2,6) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ). It starts with a number, then some coordinates or positions. The "1x1" part might mean that something is happening in a single cell or position, maybe marking it as an obstacle? Then there's another part with numbers and brackets: 2 [[1]]. I'm not sure what the double brackets mean here.

Wait, maybe each operation is describing how to modify these lists. The first number could be indicating the starting point or something like that. (2,6) might be coordinates in a grid where this value applies. Then "1x1" perhaps refers to changing that specific cell? And then 2 [[1]] – maybe inserting or marking two instances of 1 at position 6?

But looking further down, I see more operations: (3 (9,3)...), which is similar but with different coordinates and numbers. It seems like each operation is targeting a specific part of the list to modify it in some way.

I'm still not entirely sure how all these operations interact or what their goal is. Maybe they're meant to solve for something, like completing a pattern or path? Or perhaps it's about transforming the initial lists into a desired state through these steps.

Another thought: the numbers after each operation might represent counts of certain patterns or positions. For example, (1 (2,6) ...) could mean that starting at position 2 and ending at 6 with something happening once. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

I should probably look for a pattern in how these operations are applied to the initial lists. Maybe each operation is removing or adding elements based on their positions. Or maybe it's about grouping certain elements together into sublists or something like that.

Wait, the numbers after some operations go up: 1, then later they have numbers like 2,3,... up to 17. Perhaps these are iteration counts? Like performing an operation a certain number of times?

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on one operation at a time and see what it does. For example, the first operation is (1 (2,6) ...). Maybe this means that in the first list, starting from position 2 to 6, we do something with value 1. The next part is "1x1", which could mean an identity matrix or a single element? Not sure.

The mention of [[1]] at the end makes me think it's inserting another level into the structure. So maybe these operations are building up some kind of nested list based on coordinates and values?

I'm still unclear about what the purpose is, but perhaps if I try to visualize each step, I can see a pattern emerging.

Looking again, after applying all these operations, there's an end result where most elements are 1s. Maybe these operations are meant to clear out certain areas by replacing specific 0s with 1s or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the initial lists represent some kind of maze where 1s are walls and 0s are paths, and the operations are directing how to move through them? I'm not sure.

I think without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what these operations are for. Maybe if I consider each operation as a function or command in a programming language like Python, where lists can be manipulated with indexing and slicing.

For instance, (1 (2,6) ... 2 [[1]] ) could translate to something like list[1][2:7] = [1], inserting ones at positions 2 through 6. But I'm not certain if that's the right interpretation.

Alternatively, in another programming language, these operations might represent coordinate transformations or array modifications based on some rules.

I think the key here is to break down each operation into its components and see how it affects the initial lists:

1. The number before parentheses: maybe an identifier for the operation.
2. Coordinates (e.g., 2,6): positions in the list where the operation applies.
3. "1x1": perhaps a dimension or size of modification at that position.
4. Another number and brackets: indicating how many times something is done or what exactly happens.

If I can figure out each part's meaning, applying all operations should lead to a final state of these lists. But without knowing the exact rules for each operation symbol, it's challenging.

Maybe if I consider each list separately and apply the operations sequentially, I can see how they change over time. Starting with one list, then moving on to the next, modifying them according to the given operations.

Wait, another idea: these lists might be layers or steps in a process where each operation modifies the state of the previous layer to reach the final configuration. So by applying all the operations step by step, I can reconstruct how the lists should look after each modification.

In any case, it's clear that these operations are designed to manipulate arrays with specific rules. Even if I don't fully understand the notation yet, executing them systematically might help clarify their purpose and effect.

I guess the next step is to attempt applying each operation one by one on the initial lists and see how they evolve. That way, I can identify patterns or changes that guide me toward understanding what these operations are intended to do.

The user has provided a list of lists along with several operations described in a specific format. These operations likely involve modifying elements within the lists based on given coordinates, values, and other parameters. Each operation appears to target particular positions within the lists and may involve inserting or replacing elements.

Given the complexity and ambiguity of the notation, it's challenging to precisely determine each operation's effect without additional context. However, by systematically applying each operation—interpreting numbers as identifiers or commands, coordinates for positioning, "1x1" possibly indicating a single-cell modification, and brackets suggesting nested lists—the user can likely reconstruct how these modifications affect the initial structure.

The key approach is to interpret each component of an operation:
- The number before parentheses may denote an operation identifier.
- Coordinates specify positions within the list where changes occur.
- "1x1" might indicate a single-cell modification, such as inserting or replacing a value.
- Numbers followed by brackets could denote counts or additional parameters affecting how values are inserted.

By executing each operation step-by-step on the initial lists, patterns and final states can be observed. This process may involve modifying specific elements, creating nested structures, or altering values at designated positions to achieve a desired configuration.

In summary, despite the initial ambiguity in notation, applying operations systematically with an understanding of their likely components (operation identifiers, coordinates, modification parameters) will help clarify their effects and lead to a better grasp of the overall process.
