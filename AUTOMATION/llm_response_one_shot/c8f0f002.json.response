User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to parse and compute the output of some kind of tree structure. Looking at the examples provided, it seems like each node in the tree has several attributes: a value, coordinates for its position, a size which is given as (rows x columns), an index, and then a matrix filled with 0s and 1s.

Let me try to break down what's happening in these examples. In the first example, there are multiple nodes being processed, each contributing parts of the final output matrix. It looks like some operations might be combining matrices from different nodes or applying transformations based on their positions and sizes.

For instance, in the first input tree, one node has a value of 7 at position (1,0) with size (2x1). Its matrix is [[1], [1]], which seems to add something. Another node at (0,0) with a larger size contributes more rows. Then there's another part where matrices are combined or perhaps added together based on their positions.

In the output tree of the first example, most of the matrix entries become 0 except for some parts that were influenced by the input nodes' values and operations. The final value at (1,2) is 8 because one node has a higher contribution there, I suppose.

Looking at the second test example, it's similar but with different positions and sizes. Again, the output matrix seems to have certain high values where the inputs had their contributions combined or aggregated.

I think the process involves each node contributing its own matrix based on some rule (maybe adding up, taking maximums), and then these contributions are placed into a larger matrix according to their coordinates. The final step is summing all these contributions at each position in the output matrix.

So, for each node:
1. Determine its size (rows x columns).
2. Generate a matrix of 0s.
3. Fill certain positions with 1s based on some criteria—maybe related to its value or something else from the input data.
4. Combine all these matrices into one large output matrix.

But I'm not entirely sure how exactly the contributions are combined. Maybe it's a matter of multiplying each node's matrix by its index and then adding them together? Or perhaps, for overlapping regions in the output matrix, we take the maximum value from all contributing nodes?

Also, looking at the positions (like (1,0), (2,0)), I'm guessing these represent where in the output matrix this particular node's contribution will be placed. So each node's own coordinates might map to a specific location in the main matrix.

Let me try to outline an approach:
- Parse each node from the input tree.
- For each node, create its corresponding matrix based on its size and possibly other attributes like value or index.
- Determine where this matrix should be placed within the output matrix using its coordinates.
- Combine all these matrices into a single output matrix. The combination method might involve summing or taking maximums of overlapping regions.

I think for each node, we place its entire matrix at its specified position in the output matrix and then aggregate them somehow—maybe adding up if positions overlap, but looking at the examples, it seems like they either add up or set to 1. But since the first example has some 8s, which is a higher number than individual contributions, perhaps each node's value contributes by multiplying their index.

Wait, in the first input tree, there are nodes with values 7, 5, etc., and the output matrix ends up having entries like (1,2) as 8. Maybe it's because that position was covered multiple times, and each time a higher value node contributed.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is contributing its own matrix multiplied by some factor related to their index or other attributes.

I need to figure out exactly how the input tree translates into the output matrix. It seems like each part of the input tree represents a segment in the output matrix's rows and columns, with specific values filled based on certain rules.

Another thought: Maybe it's similar to image processing where different regions are masked or colored based on their properties, and then all these masks are combined to form the final image. In this case, each node is like a mask that paints specific parts of the output matrix.

So, for each node:
- Rows correspond to certain rows in the output.
- Columns correspond to certain columns.
- Value determines what values go into those cells—maybe 1 or some index-dependent value.

But how are these translated into numbers? For example, why is (1,2) equal to 8? Looking at the input tree, there's a node with value 7 and another with value 5 contributing to that position. Maybe it's a sum: 3 + 5 = 8?

Wait, in the first test case, one of the nodes has an index of 0 but contributes a matrix filled mostly with zeros except some ones. The output tree shows higher numbers where multiple such contributions are made.

I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look at each node's impact on the final matrix:

1. Nodes closer to (x,y) might contribute more based on their proximity.
2. Each node has a size which determines how many rows and columns it affects.
3. The value or index of the node could influence what values are placed in those affected cells.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's contribution is scaled by its position relative to others, but without knowing exactly the rules, it's hard to say.

Maybe I should try reconstructing a small example:

Suppose we have two nodes:
- Node A: value 2 at (0,0) with size (2x2)
- Node B: value 3 at (1,1) with size (2x2)

If the output matrix is created by placing each node's matrix at their coordinates and then taking maximums or sums of overlapping areas.

So for Node A:
Row 0: [2, 2]
Row 1: [2, 2]

For Node B:
Row 0: [3, 3]
Row 1: [3, 3]

Combined output matrix would be:

[ max(2,3) =3 , max(2,3)=3 ]
[ max(2,3)=3 , max(2,3)=3 ]

Or if adding:
6 in each cell.

But the problem is I don't know what operation to perform. The examples show that sometimes certain positions have higher numbers based on how many nodes contribute to them.

In the first example's output tree, position (1,2) has value 8 because two nodes contributed: one with index 3 contributing a 5 and another with index 0 but maybe adding up?

Alternatively, each node contributes its own index multiplied by some factor or just added as is. Maybe higher index nodes have more influence.

Wait, in the first input tree:

- The root has value 7 at (1,0) which is part of a 2x1 matrix.
- Then another node at (0,0) with a larger size contributing to multiple positions.

Looking at the output tree's final position (1,2), it's 8. So maybe 3 +5=8? Or index values multiplied by something?

I'm getting stuck because without knowing the exact operation, I can't be sure how the nodes combine their contributions into the final matrix.

Maybe looking for a pattern in the numbers:

In the first test case output:
The highest number is 9 at position (1,3). So perhaps each node's value is added together based on some criteria.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the cumulative sum of all indices' values. For example, if you have nodes with higher indices contributing more heavily.

Wait, in the first input tree:

- Node A: index 0 contributes a matrix.
- Node B: index 3 has value 7
- Node C: index 2 has value 5

So their sum is 8 at position (1,2). So maybe when multiple nodes contribute to the same cell, you take the maximum of their values? But in that case, it would be max(7,5)=7. Hmm.

Alternatively, adding them up if they are contributing: 3+5=8.

But how do I know which cells each node is affecting?

I think without a clear rule for combining contributions, I can't accurately compute the output matrix. Maybe I need to infer based on the positions and sizes.

Another idea: The size (rows x columns) of each node indicates how many rows and columns it affects in the output matrix. So nodes with larger sizes will affect more cells. Then, within that area, their value is spread out according to some rule—maybe they just set certain parts of the matrix based on their index.

But still, without knowing exactly how values are assigned or combined, this remains vague.

I think I need to look for an algorithmic approach:

1. Parse each node from the input tree.
2. For each node, determine its influence area in the output matrix—its rows and columns, starting at its coordinates.
3. Within that area, assign values based on some rule involving the node's value or index.
4. Combine all these influences into a single matrix.

Perhaps nodes' contributions are scaled by their size or their position relative to each other.

Alternatively, maybe it's similar to building an adjacency matrix where nodes influence certain cells around them, and the final cell's value is based on how many overlapping influences there are.

But given that in some cases numbers go up to 9, which seems like a combination of indices, perhaps higher index nodes contribute more significantly. Maybe their values are multiplied by something related to their position or size.

Alternatively, maybe each node contributes its own matrix as per the formula: (row + column) * value, but I don't have enough data to test that.

Wait, in the first input tree:

- Root at (1,0), index 3? Or what's the root?

Actually, without knowing exactly how nodes are positioned and their sizes, it's tricky. Maybe each node affects a grid based on its position and size, with higher indices contributing more to cells around them.

In any case, I think this problem is too abstract for me without clearer rules. Perhaps if there were more information or specific details about the operation between nodes, I could figure it out. Otherwise, it's just speculation.
</think>

To solve the problem of constructing the output matrix based on the given input tree with nodes having values and positions, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Parse Nodes**: Extract each node's value, position (x,y), and size (rows x columns) from the input.

2. **Determine Influence Area**: For each node, calculate its influence area based on its size. This involves determining which cells in the output matrix it will affect.

3. **Assign Values**: Within the influence area of each node, assign values to specific cells. The value assignment could be based on the node's index or some other rule (e.g., scaling by position).

4. **Combine Influences**: Aggregate all nodes' contributions into a single matrix. This may involve summing up overlapping influences, taking maximums, or applying another combination rule.

5. **Generate Output Matrix**: Create the final matrix based on the aggregated values from all nodes' contributions.

**Implementation Steps**:

- Start by creating an empty output matrix of appropriate size.
- For each node:
  - Calculate its influence area using its position and size.
  - Determine which cells in the matrix it affects.
  - Assign a value to these cells (e.g., based on the node's index).
  - Combine this assignment with existing values, ensuring proper handling of overlaps.

By following these steps, we can construct the desired output matrix that reflects all nodes' contributions according to specified rules.
