User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to take an input tree and generate an output tree based on some rules. The examples provided are a bit confusing at first glance, but maybe if I break them down step by step, it will make more sense.

First, looking at the structure of these trees: each node seems to be represented as (value (left subtree) (right subtree)). The numbers in parentheses after 0 and 1 indicate some kind of parameters or sizes. It looks like these might refer to dimensions—like matrix dimensions or something similar since I see terms like 3x2, which reminds me of matrices.

In the first example, the input tree is:
(0 (0, 0) (3x3) 0 [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (1 (0, 1) (3x2) 2 [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]] ) )

And the output tree is:
(0 (0, 0) (9x9) 0 [[....a bunch of zeros...]]

Looking at this, I can see that a 3x3 matrix became a 9x9 matrix. Wait, actually, no—wait: in the input, it's 3x3 and then some children with 3x2 matrices, but the output is a 9x9 matrix.

Wait, maybe each node has its own "size" which corresponds to something like an identity matrix or another specific structure. But let me see:

In the first example, the root value is 0, left child is (0,0) with a 3x3 zero matrix, and right child is a subtree starting with 1.

The output has 9x9 zeros as its third element—so maybe it's creating a larger identity matrix based on some combination of the input matrices?

Similarly, in the second example, the root is 0 again, left child (0,0) 3x3 zero, and right child starts with 1. The output has several sub-trees starting from value 1.

Looking at these examples more carefully:

The initial tree seems to have a node with value 0 that has two children: one on the left which is another node with value 0, and then a subtree for value 1; similarly on the right side. The output trees seem to be expanding each of these in some way—specifically, turning zero matrices into larger identity-like structures.

Wait, perhaps the size corresponds to the number of rows or columns being multiplied together? For example, if a node has a child with matrix dimensions mxn and kxmx l, then the parent's dimension is n x l?

But looking at the first input tree: root 0, left is (0,0) 3x3 zero. Right is a subtree starting with 1 that's 3x2.

In output, it's a 9x9 matrix—so perhaps 3*3=9? No, because 3 and then the right child is 3x2—if I multiply 3 and 2, I get 6. But 9 is 3 squared or something else?

Wait, in the first example output: root has size 9x9.

The input tree's structure seems to have a node with value 1 that had children starting at values 2 and another 2. The outputs for those seem to be structured as [1,0], [0,1]—so identity matrices of size 3x2 each? Then perhaps when these are combined, they form a larger matrix.

Alternatively, maybe the sizes correspond to the number of rows or columns in some way that gets multiplied.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each node with value k has a subtree where the leaves have either all zeros except for ones along the diagonal—so identity matrices. Then combining those as per their parent's children might lead to larger block matrices.

In the first example output tree, after processing, we see 9x9 zero matrix at (0) level, and then a lot of submatrices that are parts of this.

But perhaps more importantly, each node with value k is responsible for creating a matrix whose dimensions are determined by its position in the hierarchy. So maybe if you have a subtree where each left-right branching leads to increasing or decreasing dimensions based on some rule.

Alternatively, think about it as transforming matrices according to their parent's structure—maybe concatenating rows and columns?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the size after 0 is something like (n x m) = product of sizes from its children. For example, in the first input:

Root node has left child which is a matrix with size (3x3). Then right subtree starts with value 1, which then branches into two subtrees each with size (3x2).

So for root's value 0: perhaps it's taking both children and combining their sizes? So if the left child had 3 rows, and the right has 3 columns, maybe making a 9x6 or something. But in output, we have 9x9.

Wait, that doesn't match up with first example.

Alternatively, each node value k is responsible for generating an identity matrix of size (left_size x right_size). So if left subtree after processing has m rows and n columns, then the current node would create a block matrix where it's I_m,n or something like that.

But maybe looking at specific examples:

First output tree: root 0 becomes [9x9 zeros], which is similar to the input's zero matrix but much larger. Then under each of its children (two subtrees with value 1), they are further expanded into their own blocks, some with identity matrices and others with more structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial 3x3 in the first example is transformed by multiplying or expanding based on a certain rule—maybe replicating rows or columns to form larger blocks. Then each subsequent level multiplies these dimensions accordingly.

But without clear rules, it's hard to model exactly. Maybe I need to come up with some transformation rules based on how examples change from input to output.

Perhaps the size after 0 is calculated by multiplying the sizes of left and right subtrees? Let me test that:

In first example: Input subtree has a zero matrix at (3x3). Then its right child is a value 1 which branches into two 3x2 matrices. So if I consider each as having size m x n, then perhaps when parent node processes them, it does some operation like creating an (m^something) or (n^something).

Wait, maybe not multiplication but addition:

If left is L and right is R, then the parent's size could be [L + R] in both dimensions? Or something else.

Alternatively, since each value 1 subtree becomes a series of identity matrices, perhaps each node with value k expands its children into blocks where each block is an identity matrix scaled by some factor based on their depth or position.

But this is all very vague. Maybe instead, I can try to reverse-engineer the transformation rules from the examples given.

Looking at first input:

The left child of root (value 0) is a zero matrix of size 3x3.

Its right child is a value 1 with two children each of which are 3x2 matrices. So, the structure under root's right is: Value 1 -> [Value 2], [Value 2].

The output for root has size 9x9. Maybe because each left-right pair in the first level combines to make blocks that double or something? Wait:

In input, right subtree after value 0 has two children which are 3x2. So if we combine them as blocks, perhaps they form a larger matrix—maybe arranging side by side.

But how does this become 9x9?

Wait, 3x2 matrices when arranged in some way could lead to 6 rows or something, but output is 9x9.

Alternatively, maybe each of the two 3x2 blocks are stacked vertically and horizontally? So combining a 3x2 with another 3x2 gives 3+3=6 in one dimension. But no, 9 is not 6.

Wait, perhaps considering that when you have multiple children under a node, their sizes combine multiplicatively or additively to determine the size of the parent.

In first example:

- Root's left child has size (0,0) which becomes 3x3 zero matrix.
- Right child: value 1 with two children each being 3x2 matrices. So when you process this subtree under root, perhaps their sizes are multiplied or added to give total rows and columns for the parent.

But again, how does that lead to a single size at the root?

Wait another angle: Perhaps each node is responsible for creating an identity matrix of some sort, based on its children's sizes. Then the overall tree combines these via concatenation along rows and columns.

In first example:

- Left child (value 0) is given a zero matrix of 3x3.
- Right child has two value 2 nodes each with 3x2 matrices: [1,0;0,1] but in some arrangement. Wait, no—looking at the output, it's more like [1,0,...], so perhaps identity matrices arranged as blocks.

Wait, looking at first example's output:

(0 (0, 0) (9x9) 0 [[.... zeros...]) 

So if left child was processed into a 3x3 zero matrix but scaled to 9x9? How?

Alternatively, maybe each node is expanded based on the number of its children. For instance, root's right subtree has two value 1 nodes, so it expands that part by some factor.

But this seems unclear without knowing exact rules.

Wait, perhaps each time you have a parent node with two children, you create a block diagonal matrix where each child is placed along the diagonal.

So for example:

If left child of root is L (size m x n), and right child R is size p x q, then root would be a block diagonal matrix [[L], [R]] which would have size max(m,p) rows or something. But in first case, it's 9x9.

Wait, no—block diagonal matrices usually keep the same number of blocks but each can vary.

This isn't fitting either.

Alternatively, perhaps the size is determined by combining all children sizes into some form—if a node has k children, each child contributes its size to both dimensions multiplicatively or additively. So root's right subtree (value 1) had two children: value2 with size 3x2 and another value2 with same.

If we have two 3x2 matrices as children of a parent, then perhaps the parent will make each child into larger blocks in both dimensions. For example:

Each child is expanded into a block where if it was m x n, now becomes (m * factor) x (n * factor). If the root's right subtree had two such children, and the parent size became 9x9, perhaps scaling factor for each dimension would be 3: because 3*3=9.

But then how does that apply to left child? The root has a left child of 3x3—so if scaled by 3, it becomes 9x9 zero matrix. Then under the right subtree, each of its children (3x2) would become 9x6 matrices or something?

Wait, maybe:

If scaling factor is applied based on number of children.

Root has two children: left and right.

Left child is processed as a single block—so if original size was m x n, then root's left will be scaled by some factor s such that the total becomes s*m rows. Similarly for columns?

But output is 9x9 in first example.

So perhaps scaling each subtree based on their depth or number of children.

Alternatively, perhaps every time you have a node with two children, it creates a block diagonal matrix where each child's size contributes to the same dimension multiplicatively.

Wait, if left child was (3,3), then root would make that into 9x9 by scaling rows and columns. But why? The right subtree is value1 which has its own children—each 3x2. So perhaps each of these become scaled as well?

But how does that lead to the output's structure with multiple blocks.

Wait, in first example:

- Root's left: size (0,0) -> [9x9 zeros]
- Root's right:
    - Value1, whose children are two 3x2 matrices.
    
So perhaps root combines these three subtrees? No, it doesn't—it has only one parent.

Wait, maybe each value k in the tree creates a block of size (m x n), where m and n depend on their own processing. Then when a node is processed, its children's blocks are arranged into larger blocks according to some rule.

Alternatively, perhaps:

- Each zero matrix at depth 1 becomes an identity-like block scaled appropriately.
- Each value2 with two value3s (which are [1,0;0,1])—so their sizes were being combined as a larger identity matrix?

Wait, in the first example's output under root right subtree: 

First row is [1 followed by zeros], then next seven rows have 1 at specific positions.

This looks like multiple scaled identity matrices arranged along diagonals.

So maybe each value k node causes its children to be placed into diagonal blocks of size based on their own processing. So for example, if a child was processed as an m x n matrix, it becomes a block in the parent's larger matrix.

But without knowing exact rules about how these blocks are arranged (diagonal or concatenated), it's hard.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at output dimensions:

In first example:
- Left child of root has size 3x3 but processed as 9x9.
- Right subtree under root processes into a larger block structure with rows and columns based on how the value1 node combines its two children.

Alternatively, maybe each level's processing leads to dimension multiplication. So left child is processed from 3x3 to 9x9: 3 scaled by factor of 3 becomes 9. Similarly, right subtree (with 2 children) would have their sizes perhaps combined as a block diagonal matrix with scaling factors.

Wait, but it's not so straightforward because the output shows multiple blocks within that 9x9 and other subtrees—so maybe each child is processed into some scaled version of identity matrices arranged in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps for every node:
- If it's zero, it becomes a block matrix filled with zeros of size (scaling * m x scaling * n), where m and n are the sizes of its children.
Wait, but root has two children: left is 3x3, right is value1. So maybe:

Root processes each child into scaled versions.

But without knowing exact rules, perhaps it's time to make an assumption based on output structure.

Looking at first example:
- Root's left: size (0,0) -> becomes a [9x9 zeros] matrix.
- Root's right subtree is value1 with two children, each being 3x2 matrices processed as something. The output under root right shows blocks:

Row 1: [1, followed by seven 0s]
Rows 2 to ... : Each row has only one 1 at specific columns.

This looks like three scaled identity matrices (each of size 3) arranged along the diagonal, each starting from a different position. For example, first block is columns 1-3 in row 1; second block is columns 4-6 shifted by 2 rows? Or something else—maybe it's split into multiple blocks with certain scalings.

Alternatively, perhaps for value1 node:
- It has two children of size 3x2. Each child becomes a scaled identity-like matrix (size 3). So when arranged in the parent's right subtree, they form three separate 3x3 blocks along the diagonal.

Wait, if each child is processed into a 3x3 identity matrix, then arranging them as block diagonals would result in:

Block1: row1, columns1-3
Block2: row2, columns4-6? No, rows are shifted. Wait, maybe it's Block1 at (1,1), Block2 starting from (2, something). Hmm.

Wait, the output shows:
Row 1 has a single '1' in column1.
Row 2 has a single '1' in column4.
Row3: '1' in columns7?
No, looking back:

Output is:
[ [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
  ... ]

Wait, actually, each row has a single '1' at different positions. So this looks like permutation matrices with multiple blocks.

It's possible that under value1 node (size3x2), the processing creates an identity matrix of size3 within the larger structure—maybe permuting columns or arranging in specific ways.

Alternatively, perhaps for each child, it's processed into a block whose position is determined by its index. So leftmost block is placed at first few rows and columns, next at later ones.

But without precise rules, maybe it's time to answer based on the observation that size scales with multiplication of dimensions from children—if each value k node results in processing its own children as blocks within a larger matrix whose row and column sizes are product of child dimensions scaled appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps every time you have two children, their respective block sizes are combined into a new dimension where both rows and columns are expanded by the same factor.

But since left subtree was 3x3 and processed to 9x9 (factor 3), while right has two subtrees of size 2 each—maybe they combine as 6 columns? But in output, it's arranged with three blocks along the diagonal. So perhaps scaling is not uniform across rows and columns.

Alternatively, think that each child contributes a number equal to their own processing result, which are then concatenated per rows or diagonals.

Wait, maybe the rule is: if you have two children A (m x n) and B (p x q), then parent node becomes [[A], [B]] if arranged vertically—but in first example, right subtree has two 3x2 matrices. So scaling factor would be m = 3 for left, p= ?

Wait, maybe the rule is that each child's block size contributes to both dimensions multiplicatively.

For root processing:

- Left: (0,0) => processed as [9x9 zeros].
- Right subtree:
    - value1 node with two children, each being 3x2.
        So each child becomes a scaled version—say 3x6? Because 3 rows and 2*3 columns?
    Then arranging these side by side, they form a single block of size 9x6. But in output, it's arranged as having multiple blocks with specific 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps for each value k node:
- If the left child is m x n and right child is p x q (for binary nodes), then parent becomes [[left], [right]] vertically if processed that way—but not sure.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe it's time to provide an answer based on possible scaling factors:

Assuming each level of node processing scales row and column dimensions by the product of its children’s sizes. For example:
- For (0,0), which has two children: left 3x3, right processed as size 2*3=6? Or maybe just adding up.

But in first case, root's left is zero, so becomes [9x9 zeros]. Right subtree processes each of its two value1 nodes into something. Since it's value1 with two children (each being 3x2), their processing may lead to size 3*3=9 for the parent node? Hmm.

Wait in output under root right subtree:
Each child is processed as a block, so arranging them per position:

First block: row1 has '1' at column1
Second block: row2 has '1' at column4 (which is shifted by 3 columns)
Third block: row3 has '1' at column7—again shifting.

Wait, maybe the blocks are arranged with shifts in both directions. Each child's processing results in a certain number of rows and columns, which when arranged diagonally or permutated create this pattern.

But without precise rules on how the matrix is constructed from children, it's challenging to generalize.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you have two children A (m x n) and B (p x q), then parent becomes:
A 0
0 B

Which would be a block diagonal matrix of size m+p rows and n+q columns. But in first example:

Left child is 3x3: when processed, maybe scaled to 9x9 as zero matrix.
Right subtree has two children each being 3x2—so if parent becomes them arranged vertically? Then the right subtree would be a block of size (6 rows) x (4 columns). But in output, it's arranged with three separate blocks. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, for binary nodes:
- If left child is m x n and right child p x q, then parent becomes [left | 0; ... ; right | 0] which would be size max(m,p) rows, (n + q) columns. But again, not matching the first output's structure.

Given all these uncertainties, perhaps it's best to assume that each node's processing leads its row and column sizes to become the product of children's dimensions—maybe adding if only one child? No, in this case root has two nodes (left is 3x3) so maybe:

For left subtree: 0,0 processed as [9x9 zeros]
Right subtree:
- value1 node with two children each being size 3x2.
If each of these are scaled by something.

But without precise rules, perhaps it's time to stop here. Based on the initial information and observing that when a node has (m,n) processing leads to scaling m and n dimensions accordingly—so for (0,0), it became [9x9 zeros], which is 3^2=9 in both directions.

Then maybe, general rule: Each node's output size is determined by multiplying row and column sizes from its children. For single child of size m x n, perhaps parent becomes something scaled—maybe [m*n] size? But (0,0) has two children each 3x2?

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think that for each binary node:
- If left is A (a xb) and right is B (c xd), then the parent's size is a + c rows and b + d columns.
But in first example:

Root: [9x9 zeros], which might be from two children of 3x2 each, but arranged how? 3+3=6 rows, but output under root right has blocks that are more than 6.

Wait, maybe the scaling is by product. So for a node with left and right children:

If left child is m x n, and right child p x q,
then parent would have row size = (m * p) ? No, not sure.

Alternatively, if each level of processing combines dimensions via multiplication: so root's left has 3x3 processed to 9=3^2. Right subtree was value1 with two children each being 3x2—so their processing leads to each becoming size something like 6? Then overall parent becomes:

[9 (rows) x 9 (columns)].

But output shows under root right having blocks that correspond to 9 rows, but spread across columns in a certain way. Each block is 1 row with multiple '1's at different positions—but how?

Given the ambiguity, perhaps it's time to conclude that each node's processing leads its size to be (m * n) where m and n are dimensions from children.

Thus:

- For left child of root: (0,0), which has two children: 3x3 and something else. But without precise rules on how the parent combines these, perhaps it's safest to state that each node's processing results in a matrix whose row and column counts are determined by multiplying or adding dimensions from its immediate children.

But since I don't have exact rule definitions, this is speculative.
</think>

The size of the resulting matrix for each node can be determined based on the dimensions of its child nodes. For a leaf node (0,0), it results in a 9x9 zero matrix because 3×3=9 and similarly scaled. For non-leaf nodes with children, their sizes are calculated by multiplying or adding the dimensions from their respective children. 

The exact rules for scaling may vary without precise definitions, but each node's size can be inferred as follows:

1. Leaf node (0,0) → 9x9 zero matrix.
2. Non-leaf nodes process child nodes to determine their row and column sizes.

Therefore, the resulting matrices are:

\boxed{9 \times 9}
