User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've been given this list of numbers and some kind of breakdown. It looks like it's a matrix or a grid of ones and zeros. Let me try to make sense of it step by step.

First, the initial list has a lot of elements—like 16 sets each with several numbers. They seem to be grouped into brackets separated by commas. Maybe these are rows in some kind of matrix? I see that after the first set of brackets, there's a comment saying (1 (2,9) (3x4) 2 [[...]]). Hmm, maybe that's describing how each element is processed?

Looking at it, the numbers inside the first few brackets go from all ones down to some zeros. The next part says something about (6 (5,2) (4x3) 3 [[...]]), which might indicate another set of groups or partitions within these rows.

I also notice there's a mention of (8 (12,6) (6x6) 4 [[...]]) towards the end. The numbers here are higher, so maybe each section represents different dimensions or categories?

Perhaps this is related to grouping data into certain sections based on their positions or values. Maybe it's about partitioning these binary matrices into smaller submatrices with specific properties.

The user also included some transformations like taking (1) at position (2,9) and making a 3x4 matrix from [[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1],[1,0,1,1]]. That seems to extract specific rows or columns based on the indices.

Similarly, for the number 6 at (5,2), they create a 4x3 matrix. So maybe it's about slicing the original matrix into smaller ones based on row and column numbers?

The mention of 8 at (12,6) with a 6x6 matrix suggests that larger groupings are involved here, possibly extracting submatrices from specific sections.

I'm trying to figure out if this is part of an algorithm or a data processing task. Maybe the user wants to extract certain parts based on these indices and group them into matrices for further analysis.

But I'm not entirely sure what exactly they need help with. Are they trying to understand how to process such data, or are they stuck on some step? They mentioned "1 (2,9) (3x4)", so perhaps understanding the indexing part is confusing.

Also, seeing that there's a lot of repetition in numbers like 1s and 0s makes me think it's binary. Maybe these represent something else, like presence or absence, true or false, etc.

I'm thinking they might need assistance either in interpreting how to extract specific sections from the matrix based on those indices or perhaps understanding the groupings mentioned (like 3x4, 4x3, 6x6). Alternatively, it could be about transforming the original data into these smaller matrices for some application.

To help them better, I should ask clarifying questions. Like, are they trying to extract specific submatrices? Do they need assistance in understanding how the groupings work? Or maybe they're stuck on a particular step involving these indices?

I should probably break it down further and see if there's a pattern or rule that connects each number with its position and the subsequent matrix transformations. Maybe looking at smaller sections first would help.

Wait, let me take a closer look at one of the examples: (1 (2,9) (3x4) 2 [[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1],[1,0,1,1]]). So, maybe they're taking element 2 and 9 from some matrix to create a 3x4 submatrix. Then, the number 2 suggests that there are two such matrices? Or perhaps it's indicating something else like the count of non-zero elements?

Similarly, (6 (5,2) (4x3) 3 [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]). Maybe here, taking elements at positions 5 and 2 to create a 4x3 matrix with three such instances.

The third one is (8 (12,6) (6x6) 4 [[0,0,1,1,0,0], ... , [0,0,1,1,0,0]]). So perhaps taking elements at positions 12 and 6 to create four different 6x6 matrices.

It seems like a consistent pattern where each number is followed by two indices, then the dimensions of the resulting matrix, and then how many such submatrices there are. The numbers before the parentheses might indicate counts or labels for these groupings.

But I'm not exactly sure what's being counted here—maybe it's the value at those positions? Or something else entirely. Maybe each number represents a different category, and the indices determine where to take elements from?

Given that, perhaps they need help in understanding how to process this data according to specific rules or extract these submatrices based on given indices.

To proceed, I should probably outline steps for extracting submatrices based on given row and column indices. Maybe also explain what each part of the breakdown represents—like (number at position) (indices) (dimensions) [matrix].

But since I'm not entirely sure about the exact context or application of this data processing, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what they need. They might need help in coding this extraction process, understanding group theory aspects, or maybe something else.

I think the best approach is to ask them more specific questions to clarify their needs:
1. Are they working with binary matrices?
2. Do they need help extracting submatrices based on given indices and dimensions?
3. Is there a specific application or method they're trying to implement using this data?

Understanding these aspects will help me provide a more accurate and helpful response.

It seems you've provided a list of numbers grouped into various sections, each with specific breakdowns involving row positions, matrix dimensions, and submatrices. Here's an organized summary based on the information:

1. **First Group (3x4 Matrix):**
   - Extracted from elements at positions 2 and 9.
   - Resulting matrix:

      [1, 1, 0, 1],
      [1, 0, 1, 1]]
     ```

2. **Second Group (4x3 Matrix):**
   - Extracted from elements at positions 5 and 2.
   - Resulting matrix:
     ```
     [[0, 1, 0],
      [1, 1, 1],
      [0, 1, 0],
      [1, 1, 1]]
     ```

3. **Third Group (6x6 Matrices):**
   - Extracted from elements at positions 12 and 6.
   - Results in four such matrices:
     ```
     [[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
      [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```

**Key Observations:**
- Each group is defined by a starting number (e.g., 1, 6, 8), followed by indices indicating positions in the matrix.
- The resulting matrices have dimensions specified after the indices (e.g., 3x4, 4x3, 6x6).
- There are multiple submatrices extracted from each group based on these dimensions.

**Steps to Process This Data:**
1. **Identify Extracted Elements:** Use the given row positions (indices) to extract elements from the original matrix.
2. **Determine Submatrix Dimensions:** Based on the specified dimensions, reshape the extracted elements into submatrices.
3. **Repeat for Each Group:** Follow the same process for each group of numbers provided.

This structured approach allows you to systematically extract and analyze submatrices based on the given indices and dimensions. If you need further assistance with coding this extraction or analyzing these matrices in a specific context, feel free to ask!
