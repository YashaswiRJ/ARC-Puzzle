User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this problem here with a bunch of nodes and their attributes. It looks like each node has some kind of matrix associated with it, right? The user mentioned something about the output tree structure based on these input nodes.

First, I need to parse all the given data correctly. There are multiple lines, each representing a node. Each line starts with a number indicating the level or depth maybe. Then there's coordinates in parentheses, followed by dimensions (like 2x1), then another number which might be an identifier, and finally a matrix.

Looking at the first example provided, it seems like nodes have these attributes: position, size (as rows x columns), value, and a matrix filled with 0s and 1s. The output tree seems to aggregate some of this information into parent-child relationships.

In the test example, there are more complex matrices involved, including multiple levels and different dimensions for each node. I need to figure out how these nodes relate to each other in terms of hierarchy.

Maybe each matrix represents a part or component that contributes to a larger structure. The coordinates could indicate where each matrix is placed within a bigger grid or tree structure.

I'm thinking about how the input data can be transformed into an output tree with specific node relationships. Perhaps each parent node aggregates its children's matrices in some way, like concatenating them or combining their values.

But I'm not entirely sure yet. I need to look for patterns in both examples. In the first one, a few nodes combine to form higher-level nodes with combined dimensions and updated matrices based on the children's data.

In the test example, it's more complex with varying matrix sizes and multiple levels of nesting. I'll have to figure out how each node's position and dimensions influence its place in the tree structure.

I'm also wondering if there's a specific order or rule for how these nodes are connected. Maybe it's based on their coordinates increasing in some way as we move down the levels.

Perhaps I should start by mapping out all the input nodes with their details: level, position, dimensions, value, and matrix. Then, try to see which nodes are parents of others based on their positions or sizes.

Wait, maybe each parent node's size is determined by adding up its children's sizes in some dimension? Like if a parent has a 4x8 matrix, it might be combining two 2x1 matrices from the left and right sides?

In the test example, there are nodes like (0,0) with 4x8 matrix. Its children could be at positions (0,0), which is itself, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe each parent node has multiple children spread out across its dimensions.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to list all the input nodes first and see if I can spot any connections:

1. Node 0: position (0,0), size 4x8, value=0, matrix with four rows of eight zeros.
2. Node 6: position (0,1), size 1x1, value=2, [[1]]
3. Node 2: position (0,2), size 1x1, value=3, [[1]]
4. Node 2: position (0,5), same as above
5. Node 6: position (0,6), same matrix
6. Node 2: position (1,0), same
7. Node 2: position (1,7), same
8. Node 6: position (2,0), same
9. Node 6: position (2,7), same
10. Node 2: position (3,1)
11. Node 6: position (3,2)
12. Node 6: position (3,5)
13. Node 2: position (3,6)
14. Node 6: position (1,3), size 1x2
15. Node 2: position (2,3), same as above
16. Node 9: position (0,0), size 4x8, value=1, matrix with alternating 1s and 0s.

Wait a minute, node 9 is also at (0,0) but has a different matrix from node 0. That might mean it's another child of the parent node at (0,0). Or maybe there are multiple nodes at the same position? The problem statement probably clarifies that each position can have multiple children.

So perhaps, in the output tree, each parent node is connected to its children based on their positions within the parent's matrix. For example, a 4x8 matrix could have four rows and eight columns, so potentially up to four parents at (0,1), (0,2)...(0,8). But looking at the test input, nodes like position (3,1) are present.

This suggests that each parent node can have multiple children across its dimensions. So for a 4x8 matrix, there might be eight child nodes along the columns and four along the rows? Or maybe it's more complex based on how the matrices interact.

I think I need to figure out which positions correspond to which parts of the parent's matrix. For example, if a node has size 2x1, its position within the parent's matrix might determine where it's placed in terms of columns or rows.

But honestly, this is getting too abstract. Maybe looking for an algorithm that can parse these nodes and group them based on their positions relative to each other would help form the tree structure.

In summary, my approach should be:

1. Parse all input nodes.
2. Determine how they are connected based on position and matrix size.
3. Build a hierarchical tree where parent nodes have children according to their placement within the parent's dimensions.
4. Ensure that matrices are combined or transformed appropriately into the parent's structure.

I think starting with smaller examples might help me see the pattern more clearly. Maybe trying to map out how node 0 and its children form a subtree would be a good start.

Alright, I'll try to work through the test example step by step in my mind:

- The root is at (0,0) with a 4x8 matrix filled with zeros.
- Below it, nodes are placed at positions like (1,3), which has a 1x2 matrix. Maybe this node spans two columns within its parent's row?
- Similarly, other nodes span different parts of the matrix.

I'm realizing that each node's placement and size determines how they fit into their parent's structure. It might require some form of tiling or partitioning based on these attributes.

Perhaps I should consider using a breadth-first approach: starting from the root, then looking at all its children according to the available positions, and recursively building the tree from there.

This is definitely going to take more thought. Maybe visualizing it as a grid where each node occupies certain cells (based on size) within their parent's cell block would help in forming connections.

I think I need to write down some code or algorithm that can process these nodes and create edges based on position overlaps or adjacency. But since this is just my thinking, I'll try to outline the steps without actual coding.

Another thing: matrices with more complex values (not just 0s and 1s) might be combined using logical operations or concatenation. For example, if a parent node has two children, each contributing their own matrix parts, perhaps they are stacked vertically or horizontally based on dimensions.

I'm getting the sense that this is similar to building a tree structure for expressions where nodes represent sub-expressions and combine according to operator precedence. Maybe here, matrices serve as elements being combined into larger structures.

Wait, in the first example, node 0 has value 0 with all zeros matrix, but its children have different values (2,3) which are then included somehow. The output tree combines them into a higher-level node with a specific matrix [[1],[1]], so maybe those child nodes' matrices are being combined.

Looking at the first test example's output:

- Root is 0: position (0,0), size 4x8
   - Child at (2,3): value=2, [[1]]
   - Another child at (6,7)? Wait, in the input, node positions are like (3,6). Maybe I need to map their placement more carefully.

Hmm, perhaps each parent's children are arranged such that they fill up its matrix without overlapping. So if a parent is 4x8, it can have multiple child nodes occupying different columns or rows within this block.

This requires figuring out how many children a node has based on the sum of their dimensions. For instance, a 2x1 node would take up one column in two rows, so maybe each parent can handle multiple such placements across its grid.

I'm not sure if I'm overcomplicating it or underestimating the problem. Maybe looking for existing algorithms or data structures that represent hierarchical matrix decomposition could help, but since this is a thought process, I'll continue brainstorming.

Another idea: perhaps nodes are grouped based on their coordinates and size into rectangles within a larger grid. The output tree reflects how these smaller rectangles combine to form larger ones. Each parent node's area in the grid encompasses its children's areas without overlapping.

But then again, the exact method of combination isn't clear yet—how exactly do child matrices influence the parent matrix?

I think I need to focus on the position and size attributes first because they determine where each child is placed within a parent. Once that mapping is clear, the rest about how matrices are combined should follow.

Let's take node 0: (0,0), 4x8, value=0. Its children include nodes at positions like (1,3) with size 1x2, which might mean it occupies columns 6-7 in row 1 of its parent? Or something along those lines.

This is getting complicated without a clear visualization method. Maybe creating a grid where each node's position and span are marked would be helpful.

Wait, perhaps another way: Each node has coordinates (x,y) which denote their starting point, and spans (dx, dy). So the actual area they occupy is from x to x+dx-1 in columns and y to y+dy-1 in rows. Then parents encompass these areas without overlapping.

So for example:

- Node 0: (0,0), size (4,8) → spans rows 0-3, columns 0-7.
   - Its children might be placed at different points within this span:
      - Node a: (1,2), size (something)
      - Node b: (3,5), etc.

This way, parents have multiple child nodes arranged in non-overlapping areas. Then the tree structure reflects these spatial relationships.

But then how do the matrices combine? If each child is a submatrix within its parent's area, perhaps they are concatenated either horizontally or vertically based on their placement.

In that case, a parent node would aggregate all its children into a matrix where each child contributes a portion of the matrix. The exact order depends on their positions within the parent's grid.

This makes sense because matrices can be combined by tiling them in specific orders—left to right, top to bottom—or according to some other rule based on placement.

So, if node 0 has children at (1,3) and (6,7), for example, those might be placed side by side along the columns or rows. Their matrices would then be combined accordingly into node 0's matrix.

I think I'm getting closer to how this works now.

But translating all of this into an algorithm is still a challenge. It requires:

1. Parsing each node with its position and size.
2. Determining which parent can contain it without overlapping other nodes.
3. Assigning the child to that parent based on non-overlapping placement.
4. Once all parents are assigned, building a tree where each parent has children as per their placement.

Additionally, combining matrices correctly would require knowing how to interleave or merge the submatrices into the parent's structure. This might involve logical operations like ORs or ANDs if it's for logic circuits, but without specific rules, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the values in child nodes are part of a larger computation that the parent node represents. So combining them would mean performing some kind of operation on their values to form the parent's value.

But since we don't have information about how they combine except for examples like turning two children with 2 and 3 into [[1],[1]] in the first example, perhaps it's a specific rule—like applying some function across their values.

Overall, while I can conceptualize that nodes are part of a hierarchical structure based on position and size, executing this programmatically is non-trivial. It requires precise parsing and placement rules to group children under parents correctly.

I think the key takeaway here is understanding how each node's position and size map into its parent's area in the grid. Once that mapping is clear, building the tree becomes a matter of grouping all child nodes within their respective parent areas without overlap.

Now, if I had to implement this, what steps would I take?

1. **Parse Input**: Extract all nodes with their (x,y) positions and size dimensions.
2. **Determine Parent Assignment**:
   - For each node, determine possible parent candidates where the node can fit without overlapping other children in that parent's area.
   - Assign a node to its earliest or only possible parent based on non-overlapping constraints.
3. **Build Hierarchy**: Once all nodes are assigned to parents, create parent-child relationships and construct the tree accordingly.
4. **Combine Matrices**: Based on the parent's grid layout, compute how child matrices contribute to the parent's matrix by tiling them in specific orders or applying operations.

This seems like a multi-step problem that might require some heuristics for parent assignment since multiple nodes could potentially fit into various parents without overlapping.

But without more information on how matrices are combined, it's difficult to automate this combination step. It would probably be based on the placement order—left-to-right and top-to-bottom—if we don't have specific rules provided.

In conclusion, while I've made some progress in conceptualizing how nodes form a tree structure, executing the exact method for combining them into matrices remains unclear without additional specifications or examples.

To solve this problem, we need to parse a series of hierarchical nodes and construct a tree structure where each node's position and size determine its placement within the parent matrix. The goal is to group child nodes under their respective parents based on non-overlapping positions and then combine their matrices into the parent's structure.

### Approach

1. **Parse Input**: Extract all nodes with their (x, y) positions and size dimensions.
2. **Determine Parent Assignment**:
   - For each node, determine possible parent candidates where the node can fit without overlapping other children in that parent's area.
   - Assign a node to its earliest or only possible parent based on non-overlapping constraints.
3. **Build Hierarchy**: Once all nodes are assigned to parents, create parent-child relationships and construct the tree accordingly.
4. **Combine Matrices**: Based on the parent's grid layout, compute how child matrices contribute to the parent's matrix by tiling them in specific orders or applying operations.
