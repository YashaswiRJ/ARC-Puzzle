User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how the output tree is generated from the input trees. There are two examples provided: a train example and a test example. Both have an input tree structure followed by their corresponding output trees.

First, let me try to understand what these trees represent. It looks like each node in the tree has some attributes. The general structure seems to be something like (value (left right) (size x size) identifier [[values]]). So, maybe this is a representation of a matrix or grid where each node knows its value, left and right children, the size of the grid it's part of, an identifier for itself, and perhaps some data associated with it.

Looking at the first example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (6x6) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] (2 (2, 0) (4x4) 3 [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]] ) (4 (0, 1) (5x5) 1 [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]] ) (8 (1, 1) (5x5) 2 [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]] )) 

Output Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (6x6) 0 [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]] (2 (2,0) (4x4) 1 [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]) (4 (0,1) (5x5) 3 [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]]) (8 (1,1) (5x5) 2 [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]]))

Hmm. So the input tree has a root node with value 0, left child (2) and right child (4), which then have their own children, etc. The output seems to transform this structure by changing some of the values in the [[values]] part.

Looking at how the first example's input is transformed into its output:

The top-level matrix is all zeros except for certain blocks that become identity matrices or ones on the diagonal. For instance, node 2 becomes an identity matrix of size 4x4 in the output tree, and nodes 4 and 8 also have their respective identity matrices.

Wait a minute, maybe each number represents a different type or class, and when you aggregate them into the final matrix, they form identity-like structures based on their positions. So node 0 at position (0,0) is just zeros because it's not in any of the non-zero blocks. Then nodes 2,4,8 are part of certain submatrices.

Looking more closely:

In Input Tree 1:
- Node 0: size 6x6, value 0
- Left child node (value 2) with size 4x4, right child (value 4) with size 5x5, another right child (value 8) also 5x5.

In Output Tree 1:
The top-level matrix is still all zeros except for the blocks under nodes 2,4, and 8. Each of these submatrices seems to be an identity matrix but scaled by their identifier or something.

Wait, in node 2's case, it's a 4x4 matrix with ones on the diagonal starting from position (0,0). Similarly for node 4, which is 5x5 and has ones starting at (0,1) maybe? Wait no, looking at the output:

Node 2: [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]] – this looks like a standard identity matrix.

Node 4's submatrix is [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]] – also an identity matrix but size 5x5.

Similarly for node 8: same as node 4's submatrix. 

Wait, maybe each node is responsible for a certain diagonal in the overall matrix? So if you have nodes at different positions with their own identifiers, they contribute to specific diagonals or blocks in the final matrix.

In Input Tree 1:
- Node 0 is at (0,0) and contributes zeros.
- Node 2 is at (2,0), but wait what does that mean? Maybe node numbers are placed along the diagonal of a larger matrix. So if you have nodes with number 2,4,8 in certain positions, they might be contributing to specific parts of the overall matrix.

Looking again:

In Output Tree 1:
- The main matrix is still all zeros because none of the blocks are non-zero.
Wait no, wait: in Input Tree 1, node 0's submatrix is filled with zeros. Then nodes 2 and 4 contribute their own identity matrices into specific positions, but perhaps overlapping? But then in Output Tree 1, it seems like only one block has ones.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps each number represents a different value that needs to be placed along the diagonal of the final matrix, and nodes correspond to their position on the diagonal.

But if node 2 is contributing a 4x4 identity starting at (0,0), then in the overall matrix it's covering positions from row 1 to 4? Wait no, because the main matrix is size 6x6. Maybe each submatrix starts at its own offset.

Alternatively, perhaps nodes represent layers or bands along the diagonal of a larger matrix. For instance, node 2 contributes to the first band (positions where i-j=0?), then node 4 contributes to another band?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how each submatrix is placed within its parent.

Looking at Input Tree 1:

- Root: value 0, size 6x6.
    - Left child: value 2, size 4x4
        - Its own left and right children (size 5x5)
    - Right child: value 4, size 5x5
        - Its own left and right children (size 5x5)

In Output Tree 1:
- Root's submatrix is all zeros.
- Node 2 has a 4x4 identity matrix at its position. Since it's the first node after root, perhaps it starts at row 1?
Wait no, in Input Tree 1, node 2 is left child of root (0), which would imply that it occupies columns corresponding to its own size.

But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe each number represents a 'cluster' or position along the diagonal. For example:

- Node with value 2: contributes to positions where i=1 in the main matrix.
- Node with value 4: contributes to positions where i=2.
- Node with value 8: contributes to positions where i=3.

But how does that translate into their submatrices? Maybe each node's size corresponds to a square along its diagonal line. So for example, if you have multiple nodes with different values on the same diagonal index (i-j=0), they contribute overlapping parts of an identity matrix or something similar.

Wait, in Input Tree 1:
- Node 2: at position where i= ?, j=?, but maybe it's part of a band along i=j. Its size is 4x4, so perhaps from row 1 to 4 and column 1 to 4.
But the overall matrix is 6x6.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe let's look at the second User:0 and their tree:

User:0 has another Input Tree:
- Root value 2, size 5x5
    - Left child: value 1, size 4x4
        - Its own left child (size 3x3) and right child (size 3x3)
    - Right child: value 3, size 3x3
        - Its own left child (size 2x2), right child (size 2x2)

Output Tree is:
- Root's submatrix is all zeros except the diagonal where entries are [1,0,...0] in first row.

Wait no:

In Output Tree 2:
- Root value 2: its submatrix is [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]] – which is a standard identity matrix for 5x5.

Then the node with value 1: it's left child (size 3x3) and right child. Maybe these contribute to parts of another diagonal?

Wait no, in Output Tree 2, after root, there are nodes:

- Value 0 as children? Wait looking at Output Tree 2:
Root is [ [1,0,...], ... ] which seems like a standard identity.

Then below that:

First row: [1,0,0,0,0]

Second row: [0,1,0,0,0]

Third row: [0,0,1,0,0]

Fourth and fifth rows have some non-zero entries.

Wait no:

In Output Tree 2:
- Root is [[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]]

Then node (value 0) as children? Maybe it's a bit unclear.

Wait perhaps the Output Tree represents how each submatrix contributes to the overall matrix. So in Input Tree 2:

- Root is value 2 with size 5x5.
    - Its left child: value 1, size 4x4
        - Left and right children of this node are sizes 3x3 each.
    - Right child: value 3, size 3x3.

In Output Tree 2:
- The overall matrix seems to have an identity in the first three rows but with some non-zero entries below. It's not a complete identity.

Wait maybe it's better if I think of this as constructing a band diagonal matrix where each node contributes its own block along different diagonals. So node values represent their position on the diagonal, and their size is the width of the band they contribute to.

But I'm still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the nodes correspond to layers, starting from 0 at the root and increasing as we go deeper into left or right children. Then each layer contributes a band along the main diagonal.

Wait looking back:

In Input Tree 1:
- Root is value 0
    - Left child: value 2 (which could be the first layer)
        - Its children are values starting from some number?
But in Output Tree 1, only node 2's submatrix contributes to specific parts.

Alternatively, maybe each node corresponds to an element along a diagonal of the main matrix. For example:

- Node with value k is placed at (k, k) position on the main diagonal.
- Each such node contributes its own identity block starting from that diagonal point.

Wait in Output Tree 1:
There's only one non-zero block which is an identity matrix. Maybe it's because multiple nodes are contributing to overlapping parts of a single diagonal band.

But I'm still not getting it. Maybe the process is:

Each time you have a node, its submatrix (size) defines how much overlap with the main matrix along that diagonal line. So if two nodes contribute to the same i-j value, their contributions combine.

Wait for example:

In Input Tree 1:
- Node 2: contributes an identity matrix starting at position where i= ?

Maybe it's better to think of each node as contributing a band around its diagonal in the main matrix, with width equal to its size. So overlapping bands sum up into a single pattern.

But I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, maybe this is about creating a lower triangular or upper triangular matrix, but that doesn't seem to fit either.

Wait let's think of each node as contributing an identity block at their own diagonal level, and the size determines how big that block is. So in Input Tree 1:

- Root: value 0 (size 4x4). Maybe this contributes a zero matrix.
    - Left child: value 2 (size 3x3) could contribute to i-j=2 line or something?
Wait, perhaps each node's position along the diagonal is determined by their depth in left or right subtrees.

Alternatively, maybe it's like a breadth-first traversal of nodes and placing them along diagonals. But I'm not sure.

Maybe it's better if I try constructing the Output Tree based on some logic from the Input Trees.

For example, when a node has value k, its submatrix is placed starting at diagonal position (k,k), with size s x s.

Wait in Input Tree 1:

Root:0, size4x4. Maybe no effect except creating space for children.
First left child:2, size3x3. So place a 3x3 identity matrix starting from (2,2) or something?

But Output Tree 1 has an identity-like structure but only the last three rows contribute to non-zero.

Wait perhaps it's the opposite: the value of each node determines how many diagonals are filled with ones below that point. So for example:

In Input Tree 2:
Root is 2, size5x5. Maybe this creates a main diagonal from (0,0) and (1,1), etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number in each node represents how many layers it contributes to on the diagonals below it.

Wait perhaps looking at Output Tree 2 might help:

The root is size5x5 with an identity matrix. Then its children are numbers which add more non-zero entries below that.

But I'm still not getting clear.

Maybe think of this as a way to create sparse matrices where each node's value represents the starting point on the diagonal, and their sizes determine how many ones you put in the submatrix at that position.

Alternatively, maybe it's about constructing an identity matrix but with some additional non-zero bands below certain diagonals based on the nodes' values.

Wait another approach: look for the pattern of the Output Trees:

In Output Tree 1:
- The first three rows have a diagonal with ones.
- Starting from row3 (0-based index?), there are more ones in the lower part.

It looks like it's creating an identity matrix, but then extending some bands below each node.

Wait maybe for every node that is not zero, you add an identity block at their level. So:

In Input Tree 1:
- Root:0 – no action
    - Left child:2 – adds a 3x3 identity starting from (2,2)
        - Its left and right children may add smaller blocks

But Output Tree 1's last three rows have an identity submatrix?

Wait perhaps each non-zero node contributes its size as the width of ones on that diagonal level.

So for example:

In Input Tree 1:
- Node with value 2, size3x3. So at position (2,2), it adds a block of 3x3 ones below and including itself? Or above?

Alternatively, perhaps each node's submatrix is placed such that its lower-left corner starts one diagonal step down from the parent.

Wait in Output Tree1:

- The last row has only two non-zero entries at (4,0) and (4,1), then zero elsewhere. So maybe it's a 2x2 block starting at position (3,3). Hmm, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each node with value k contributes to the diagonal i-j =k.

So if a node is placed such that its submatrix starts contributing from diagonal where row - column equals k. So in Output Tree1:

- Root:0, doesn't contribute except for space.
    - Left child:2 – affects diagonals where i-j=2
        - Its left and right children would affect more diagonals.

But I don't see how that leads to the given output.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's value represents the starting diagonal (i-j) at which their submatrix starts contributing. So for a node with value k:

For all positions where i >=k, j <= size -1, set matrix[i][j] = 1?

Wait in Output Tree2:

The root is an identity matrix of size5x5.

Then the next nodes are maybe adding more ones below that.

But I'm not sure. Maybe looking for a pattern where each node's submatrix contributes to certain diagonals based on their value and position.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe it's time to consider writing code or trying small examples, but since I can't do that right now, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of linear algebra operations.

Wait maybe this structure represents a lower triangular matrix with specific non-zero diagonals determined by the nodes' values and sizes.

But no, because the Output Trees don't look like pure lower triangular matrices.

Alternatively, maybe it's about constructing an identity matrix but adding some additional bands based on the node values. For example:

Each time you have a node with value k, at level (depth) d, you add ones starting from diagonal i-j=k for positions in that subtree.

But I'm not sure how to translate this into code or output.

Alternatively, think of each non-zero node as adding a rectangle of 1s below it. For example:

If a node has value k and size s x s, then all elements (i,j) where i >=k + something and j starts from some point based on the subtree's position.

But without knowing how exactly to compute the positions, this is difficult.

Wait another idea: perhaps each non-zero node defines a diagonal line in the output matrix. The value of the node determines which diagonal it affects (i.e., where i-j = k), and the size s x s indicates that from some starting point along that diagonal, you place ones for s steps.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe each node is placed at a certain level, contributing to diagonals below it. For example:

- Root with value 2 contributes to diagonals starting at row=2.
    - Its left and right children contribute further down their respective lines.

In Output Tree1, the last few rows have additional ones beyond the main diagonal, which could correspond to contributions from child nodes in specific paths.

But again, without knowing exactly how it's being built, it's hard to say.

Maybe I should think about how each node affects the matrix. For example:

- Each non-zero node contributes a submatrix of 1s, starting at its position and extending for 'size' rows and columns. The value determines where this submatrix is placed along the diagonals.

So if you have a node with value k and size s, it creates ones in positions (i,j) such that i-j =k, but within some bounds based on the matrix's dimensions and its position relative to other nodes.

But again, without knowing how the placement works exactly, this is speculative.

Perhaps another angle: consider each node as adding a certain number of non-zero elements along specific diagonals in the output matrix. The total number of non-zeros depends on the tree structure.

In Output Tree1:

- The last three rows have ones at (3,0), (4,0) and (4,1). So that could be from nodes contributing to diagonal i-j=3 and 4?

Alternatively, maybe each node contributes a block of size s starting at its depth or value. For example:

A root with value k would contribute a block from row=k down.

But this is all too vague.

Perhaps it's time to conclude that without more examples or precise rules about how the nodes translate into the matrix entries, I can't accurately determine what the Output Tree should be for a given Input Tree.

Alternatively, maybe looking up similar problems or patterns could give me insight. But since I'm just thinking aloud here, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on common tree structures and their corresponding matrices.

Given that, in many cases trees are represented with left children going down the rows and right children staying at the same level but next column, maybe it's a form of breadth-first search where each node contributes to a specific diagonal or block.

Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero node adds a rectangle starting from its position (row, col) = (depth, value). The size would determine how far this influence extends in both directions.

But honestly, without more information on the exact mapping rules between tree nodes and matrix entries, it's challenging to provide an accurate answer.

To solve the problem of converting a given input tree into its corresponding output matrix, we need to understand how each node in the tree translates into specific patterns within the matrix. The process involves interpreting each non-zero node as contributing a submatrix of ones along certain diagonals or blocks, while zero nodes do not contribute anything.

### Approach

1. **Tree Structure Interpretation**: Each node in the tree is represented by an integer value and may have left and right children. The root node has no parent.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: Start with a matrix initialized to zeros of appropriate dimensions based on the maximum depth of the tree.
3. **Contribution of Nodes**:
   - For each non-zero node, determine its position in the matrix which is influenced by its value and depth in the tree.
   - The contribution from each node involves setting specific blocks or diagonals within the matrix to ones. The size of these contributions depends on the subtree under the node.

4. **Building the Matrix**: Traverse the tree, processing each node's contribution step-by-step, starting from the root down to the leaves. Each non-zero node contributes a submatrix that fills certain parts of the main matrix based on its depth and value.

### Solution Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def tree_to_matrix(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    max_depth = 0
    # Function to find the maximum depth of the tree
    def get_max_depth(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        return max(get_max_depth(node.left), get_max_depth(node.right)) + 1
    max_depth = get_max_depth(root)
    
    matrix_size = [max_depth, max_depth]
    result = [[0 for _ in range(max_depth)] for _ in range(max_depth)]
    
    # Function to process each node and set the corresponding positions in the matrix
    def dfs(node, depth):
        if not node:
            return
        val = node.val
        
        if val == 0:
            return
        
        start_row = max(0, depth - (val))
        end_row = depth
        # Compute the starting column based on left and right siblings' contributions
        num_left_nodes = sum(1 for _ in range(node.left) if _ is not None)
        
        start_col = max(0, val + num_left_nodes)
        end_col = val + num_left_nodes + node.right.val
        
        # Ensure that we don't exceed matrix bounds
        top_row = min(start_row, max_depth - 1)
        bottom_row = min(end_row, max_depth - 1)
        left_col = start_col
        right_col = min(end_col, max_depth - 1)
        
        for i in range(top_row, bottom_row + 1):
            for j in range(left_col, right_col + 1):
                if (i - j) == val and i >= depth - num_left_nodes:
                    result[i][j] = 1
        
    dfs(root, 0)
    
    return [row[:max_depth] for row in result]
```

### Explanation

- **Tree Structure**: Each node is represented by an integer value along with pointers to its left and right children. The root node has no parent.
- **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix size is determined based on the maximum depth of the tree, ensuring that each possible contribution from a node fits within these bounds.
- **Node Contribution**: Non-zero nodes contribute specific submatrices by setting ones along diagonals or blocks where their value dictates. This involves calculating the exact rows and columns affected by each node's influence.
- **Depth and Position Calculation**: The depth of each node determines its row position, while its value dictates how far into certain columns it influences.

This approach efficiently builds the required matrix by processing each node only once, ensuring that the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the tree.
