User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, so I'm trying to understand this input tree structure that's given. It looks pretty complex with all these numbers and sublists. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the main structure seems to be a list of elements where each element has three parts: an integer, another pair of integers, and a third part which is either an integer or a list. The overall format is something like (number (a b) (c d) e). Each "e" at the end could represent some kind of result or maybe a node in a tree.

Looking at the first element: it's 0 followed by [0, 0], and then another part which is also 0. Then there's this big matrix with all zeros. Hmm, that's a 17x17 matrix filled with zeroes. I wonder why that is. Maybe each of these numbers represents something in a grid.

Next, I see an element with the number 8, followed by (4, 0), and then another part which is 3x3, ending with [1,1,1]. Wait, so this might be referring to some kind of submatrix or maybe indices? The number 8 could be a key identifier for that node.

Then there's another element starting with 5, followed by (4,0), and then a 3x3 matrix. This one has [1,1,1] as the last part. I'm not sure what these numbers mean yet. Maybe they are coordinates or some kind of identifiers within the larger structure.

Looking further down, there's a test example input that starts with (0 ... something) and ends with 4 (something). It also includes an 17x17 matrix again. This might be another part of the tree where each node has its own submatrix or some kind of operation applied.

I think I'm missing the context here, but perhaps these numbers represent nodes in a graph or something similar, and the matrices are adjacency lists or weight matrices for connections between nodes. The 17x17 matrix filled with zeros might indicate that there's no connection between many nodes except maybe some specific ones represented by [1s] in other parts.

The number 8 followed by (4,0) could be a node identifier where the first part is the level or something and the second part is an index. The fact that it's connected to another submatrix might mean there's a connection from this node to others.

I'm also noticing multiple instances where numbers are paired with matrices of various sizes—like 3x3, 1x1. Maybe each number corresponds to a specific operation or transformation applied on the matrix. For example, multiplying by a certain factor or setting all elements to zero except for some positions.

The fact that there's an element starting with 5 followed by (4,0) and another submatrix suggests recursion in the tree structure—each node can have its own set of nodes defined similarly.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning of these numbers and matrices without more context. It might be helpful to think of this as a graph where each number is a node with certain attributes (like connections or weights) represented by the following parts. The submatrices could define adjacency lists for those nodes, specifying which other nodes they connect to.

Also, noticing that some elements have 1s in their matrices might indicate that there's an activation or presence at specific connections. Maybe each matrix is a transformation layer where applying it would alter how information flows through the tree.

Another thing I'm considering is whether these numbers are indices into some array of nodes or if they're identifiers for properties like depth, parent node, etc. The 17x17 matrix being all zeros could imply that most connections in this part are inactive unless specified by other matrices with ones.

I think to solve this properly, I'd need to parse the structure recursively—each main element is a node containing information about its children nodes (the subsequent parts). Each child then has its own set of properties. By traversing this tree from the root down, I could build up a data model that represents all these connections and transformations.

Perhaps each number before the brackets is an identifier for the node itself, while the numbers in the sublists are identifiers or offsets to other nodes. The matrices might be defining how inputs flow through the network, with zeros indicating no connection and ones indicating connections.

In summary, this input tree seems to define a hierarchical structure where each node has attributes that can influence its children. Without specific context on what these structures represent (like neural networks, graphs, or something else), it's challenging to interpret exactly, but structurally, it's a complex nested list with multiple levels of nodes and connections.

The input tree is a structured representation consisting of nodes with various attributes, including integers and matrices. Each node has three components: an integer identifier, another pair of integers (possibly indices or properties), and a third part which can be either an integer or a matrix. The structure suggests a hierarchical or recursive organization, potentially representing connections in a graph, layers in a neural network, or similar systems.

Key observations include:
1. Nodes are defined with numeric identifiers and subcomponents.
2. Matrices within nodes may represent adjacency lists or weight matrices for connections.
3. The tree structure allows for recursion, where each node can have its own set of child nodes.

Without additional context, the exact interpretation depends on the domain (e.g., graphs, neural networks), but it provides a framework for modeling hierarchical relationships with matrix-based transformations.

**Answer:**  
The input represents a structured tree where each node contains an integer identifier, another pair of integers, and a third part that can be an integer or matrix. This structure suggests a recursive organization potentially used to model connections or transformations in systems like graphs or neural networks. Each matrix may define adjacency lists or weights for connections between nodes, with zeros indicating inactive links and ones indicating active connections.
