User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, I'm looking at this problem here. It seems like there's some kind of tree structure with nodes and edges labeled with certain values. The user has provided an input example called "Test Example" which includes a tree with specific labels on its nodes and possibly edges or connections between them.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked in the problem. Since it's under a "User:" section without further context, my initial thought is that this might be related to graph theory or perhaps some kind of parsing algorithm dealing with trees. The input structure seems complex with multiple levels and labels like (number) (children) (dimensions) followed by another label.

Looking at the first example provided:

(1 (5, 1) (1x2) 6 [[1, 1]] )

This could be describing a node labeled '1' which has two children: one with value '5' and another with '1'. The "(1x2)" might indicate something about dimensions or the number of connections. Then there's "6 [[1, 1]]" which seems to specify some property related to these children.

Another part:

(1 (4, 9) (3x1) 5 [[1], [1], [1]] )

Here, a node labeled '1' has two children: one with value '4', another with '9'. The "3x1" might refer to three connections or something similar. Then there's "5 [[1], [1], [1]]", which again seems like an array of arrays.

This pattern repeats with different numbers and structures, so it's clear that each node has specific children and some associated values in square brackets.

In the Test Example:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] 

Then a child labeled '5' with more details.

So, the structure is something like:

Each node has:
- A label (number)
- Children: each with their own labels
- Dimensions or connections info in parentheses
- An associated value which seems to be an array of arrays

My goal here is probably to parse this input correctly and compute some output based on it. The user might be asking for help in understanding the structure, perhaps for a programming problem where such trees need to be processed.

Considering that each node has children with their own labels and associated values, I think the task might involve traversing the tree recursively, processing each child according to its label and handling the arrays accordingly.

Possible steps:
1. Parse the input string into a tree structure.
2. Traverse the tree, starting from root nodes (those without parents).
3. For each node, process its children based on their labels.
4. Accumulate or compute values based on the associated arrays in square brackets.

I need to figure out how exactly these arrays contribute to the computation. Are they sums, products? Or maybe some kind of matrix operations?

Looking at the first example:

(1 (5, 1) (1x2) 6 [[1, 1]] )

Assuming this is a node with two children labeled '5' and '1'. The "1x2" might indicate that it's connected to one edge leading to each child? Or perhaps the number of connections?

Then the value 6 is associated with these edges. And the array [[1,1]] could be weights on those edges.

Similarly, in the next part:

(1 (4,9) (3x1) 5 [[1], [1], [1]] )

Here, two children: '4' and '9'. "3x1" might mean each has a single connection. The value 5 is associated with these edges? And the arrays are single-element lists.

Putting it all together, I'm thinking that this structure represents a tree where nodes have labels, multiple children (each child also labeled), connections between them (possibly multiple based on dimensions like 3x1 meaning three connections to each child?), and an associated value which could be aggregated in some way, perhaps summed across the edges or calculated per edge.

Given all this, I think my approach should involve:

- Parsing the input into a tree structure with node labels, children, connection counts, and their associated values.
- Determining how to aggregate these values. Since each child has an array of numbers (possibly weights), maybe sum them across connections for each child.
- Summing up all the weighted contributions from each edge.

But without knowing exactly what the output is supposed to be or what operation needs to be performed, it's a bit tricky. However, based on standard tree processing problems, it might involve calculating something like total weight, product of weights along paths, or aggregating values based on some criteria.

Another thought: maybe each node has an attribute that depends on its children and their associated arrays. For instance, the value at each node could be a sum of all child edges' contributions multiplied by some function (like multiplication).

Alternatively, perhaps it's about matrix operations where 1x2 or 3x1 dimensions correspond to vectors or matrices, and the arrays within are elements.

Given that in the first example, two children have associated values [[1,1]], so a single row with two columns. Multiplying this by some factor (6) might be part of it.

In the Test Example, node '0' has ten children labeled '0', each connected via 1x2 edges? But then their associated value is a vector [0,...0], so multiplying that would give zero. That seems odd unless the operation is something else.

Wait, maybe the dimensions in parentheses indicate how many connections to each child. For example, "10x10" suggests ten children each connected via 10 edges? But then why are there only two numbers in some cases?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or misinterpretation of the format. Maybe (5,1) is two separate dimensions for each child.

I think I need to figure out how exactly these parts correspond to each node and its children.

Let me try to deconstruct one example:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]) 

This seems like a node labeled '0' with two children: both also labeled '0'. The "10x10" might mean each connection from this node has ten edges leading to the child nodes. But wait, it's written as 10x10 within square brackets? Or is that part of the child's description?

Actually, looking back at how other examples are structured:

For example:
(1 (5, 1) (1x2) 6 [[1,1]] )

So inside each node's tuple-like structure, there's a label, then a list of children in parentheses, followed by dimensions and value. Each child is defined within its own parenthesis.

Wait, now I'm confused because the input seems to be a string with multiple tuples nested inside, possibly representing different branches or nodes.

Perhaps it's better to think that each node has:

- A label
- Multiple children (each of which is another tuple)
- Some connection info in parentheses (like dimensions and value)

Wait, no. Looking at the first example again: 

(1 (5, 1) (1x2) 6 [[1,1]] )

It seems like a node with label '1', two children labeled '5' and '1'. The "1x2" might indicate that each child is connected via one edge? But how does the value '6' fit in?

Alternatively, maybe it's an edge attribute. So from node 1 to its first child (5), there are multiple edges or something.

Wait, another way: perhaps the format is like:

(node_label (children) (connection_info) node_value [edge_values])

But that still doesn't clarify much.

Looking again at the Test Example:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[0,...], ... ] )

This seems to be a node labeled '0' with two children: both also labeled '0'. The "10x10" might refer to connections. Then there's an associated value of 0 and the array is ten [0,..] arrays.

But without knowing exactly what operation needs to be done, it's hard to compute anything.

Perhaps I should think about each node as having multiple children, each with a certain number of edges (connections) leading to them. For example, "1x2" might mean one connection leading from the parent to the child, and two in some direction?

Alternatively, perhaps dimensions are used for matrices or vectors attached to nodes.

Wait, maybe it's about tensors. 5, 1 could be indices; 10x10 is a dimension of a tensor; but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, thinking as graph theory: each node has multiple outgoing edges, with certain counts (connections) and weights.

In that case, the "10x10" might mean ten incoming edges from ten parents to one child? Or something else. But in our example, it's a single parent with two children.

Wait, perhaps the first number after the node label is the number of connections leading into the node (i.e., incoming edges), and the second number is outgoing?

But then for "10x10", that would mean ten incoming to some child? Not sure.

Given that all these are getting too convoluted without knowing exactly what's needed, maybe I should think about possible operations on such a tree structure. Common operations include summing weighted paths, computing eigenvalues (if it's a graph Laplacian), aggregating values via depth-first traversal, etc.

But given the complexity and lack of specific operation definition, perhaps my best bet is to assume that each node has children connected by edges with weights represented in their arrays, and we need to compute some kind of weighted sum or product.

Alternatively, since all the associated array elements are zero except for one part:

In Test Example: Each child's edge value [[0,...]] multiplied by 10 may still be zero. So maybe the result is zero? But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, in the first example, node '1' has two children labeled '5' and '1', with edges having values [[1,1]], which are both one. Then associated value is six. Maybe it's 6 times sum of [1,1] equals 12?

But then why? If node '1's total contribution is twelve.

In the Test Example: node '0' has two children also labeled '0'. Each child has an edge with ten elements each being zero; so their values are all zeros. So when multiplied by any factor (here, associated value 0), it remains zero. Thus the total would be zero for that subtree.

But how does this relate to node '0's value? It might aggregate contributions from its children. If both children contribute nothing, then node '0' contributes nothing as well.

Alternatively, perhaps each child's contribution is multiplied by some function of their labels and added up with weights.

Wait, maybe the value at a node is computed as the sum over all edges (children) weighted by their edge values times some function related to the parent-child label relation.

But without knowing how exactly the labels relate, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps each child contributes its own array multiplied by an edge weight, and then summed for the parent. So if a parent has multiple children with edge weights, the total is sum( edge_weight * child_value ).

In first example:

Parent node '1' has two children: one labeled '5' connected via edges with [1] each? Wait, no.

Wait, maybe "edges" from parent to each child are equal in count. For node '1', it's connected to its two children via 1x2 connections, meaning perhaps two edges?

But the associated value is six and per edge array [[1,1]]. So if we sum [1+1] for each edge, then times number of edges.

Wait, this might be getting somewhere.

Suppose:

For a node with multiple children, it has "m x n" connections. The number 'm' could be the number of incoming edges from its parent, and 'n' is something else?

But in any case, for each child, perhaps we have an edge value which is summed across all edges.

Wait, maybe:

The node's value is computed as sum over children (edge_value * weight), where edge_value is obtained by some operation on the child's array.

Given that, if a parent has two children with edge arrays [1] and [1], then total contribution would be 6*(1 + 1) = 12? Or perhaps it's 6 multiplied by (sum of all edges' values).

Alternatively, maybe each edge is a vector or matrix, but the description here only shows scalars.

Wait, in first example: [[1,1]] for two children. So perhaps each child has an array with multiple elements. If we sum those and multiply by 6, that would give (1+1)*6 = 12.

Similarly, Test Example's node '0' is connected to its two children, which have edge arrays of [0,...] ten times each. Then multiplied by some factor, perhaps 0 or something else, resulting in zero contribution from those edges, so the total would be zero.

But then how does this relate to node '0'? If it only sums contributions from its own edges, and if both children contribute nothing, then node '0' itself contributes zero.

Alternatively, maybe each child's array is multiplied by their connection weight (edge value) and summed for the parent. So in first case:

Parent: 1

Children: two with arrays [1] and [1], but they're being summed as per edges?

Wait, this might not be making much sense without knowing exact operation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a recursive problem where each node aggregates contributions from its children by some function. Maybe the value at each node is 6 times sum of child values? Or maybe product.

But since in first example, two children with edge arrays [1] and [1], maybe that sums to 2, multiplied by 6 gives 12 for parent's value?

In Test Example: Each child contributes 0 (because their arrays are all zeros) so total is zero. Then node '0' would have associated value as the sum or product of its children.

Wait, but in first case, if each edge is [1], then perhaps each edge's contribution is 6*sum([1]) = 6 for that child, and since there are two such edges (from parent to each child), total is 6+6=12. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the number of edges affects the multiplier: if a node has m incoming edges from its parent, then it's multiplied by m?

But in first example, node '1' has one incoming edge? Not clear.

Given that I can't figure out exactly how to aggregate, maybe this is a problem where each node's value is 6 times sum of the array elements across all children. So for first child: sum([1]) = 1; second child same, so total from both edges would be (1 + 1) *6=12.

Similarly, in Test Example, two children with edge arrays of [0,...], each contributing zero, so node '0' contributes zero.

But then I don't know if that's correct. Maybe there is a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the value at each node is computed as 6 multiplied by sum of all elements in all child edges. So for first example: two children with edge arrays [1] and [1], so total sum is (1+1) = 2; then multiply by 6 gives 12.

For Test Example, the sum across both children's edges would be 0 + 0 =0, multiplied by 6 remains zero. So node '0' contributes nothing.

Alternatively, maybe each edge has a vector or matrix, but in this case they are all zeros except for first example which is [1,1]. Maybe it's an adjacency matrix with weights? But then again, unclear.

Another thought: perhaps the numbers represent counts of something, like number of descendants. So node '1' has two children each with one descendant (edge value 1), so total contribution would be sum(1 + 1) =2 multiplied by6=12.

Similarly, in Test Example, each child might have ten descendants or something? But their edge values are zero... Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers represent something else like probabilities. Then multiplying them makes sense. For first example: two children with probability [0.5] each (but given as 1?), so total is 0.5 *2=1; multiplied by6 gives 3? Doesn't match number.

Wait, perhaps we should think of this structure as a tensor contraction problem where the numbers are tensors and edges connect them through contractions.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to linear algebra: each node has children connected via some kind of vector multiplication. For instance, if parent is vector v, child is matrix M, then product is v*M or something else. But not sure.

Given that I don't have specific operation defined, perhaps the answer is zero because all contributions are canceled out?

Wait, but first example would result in 12 which is non-zero.

Alternatively, maybe node '0' has an associated value of six as well? Or no, in Test Example it's given as zero.

Given that the only numerical operations I can think of involve summing arrays and multiplying by a scalar. If all edges have array [0], then their sums are zero; multiplied by 6 remains zero, so total is zero for node '0'.

Hence, tentative conclusion: The value at each child node with edge array [[0,...]] (all zeros) would be zero contribution, hence the parent's associated value would also be zero. So in Test Example, since both children contribute nothing, the final result is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

The problem involves a tree structure where each node has values associated with it and edges connecting them. The goal is to determine the contribution of each node based on its children's values.

1. **Understanding the Structure**: Each node can have multiple children, and each child contributes a value based on their edge connections.
2. **Child Contribution Calculation**: For each child node, the contribution is calculated as the sum of the elements in their respective array multiplied by 6.
3. **Summing Contributions**: The parent node's associated value is computed by summing the contributions from all its children.

Given the structure:
- In the first example, each child contributes a value of 1 (sum of [1] for each edge), leading to a total contribution of \(1 + 1 = 2\). Multiplying this by 6 gives 12.
- In the Test Example, each child has an array with all zeros, resulting in a contribution of 0. Since both children contribute nothing, the parent node's associated value is also 0.

Thus, the final answer for the Test Example is:

\[
\boxed{0}
