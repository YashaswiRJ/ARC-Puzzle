User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this input tree that needs to be processed. Let me try to understand what it's doing step by step. It looks like each node has a number of children and some associated data.

Starting from the root (0), it has nine children. Each child is another tuple with numbers and sub-trees. The first child is (2 (0, 3) ...). Hmm, so maybe each number after the initial part represents something about the subtree structure or node attributes?

Looking at one of these nodes, like (6 (3, 0) (1x1) 4 [[1]]), it has a size of 1x1 and some value in the matrix. I guess each of these numbers is significant for how the tree processes data.

I'm not exactly sure what this tree is supposed to do, but maybe it's building a hierarchical structure based on the nodes' parameters. The final part with [[1]] seems like it could be storing some information or results from the processing.

Wait, there are also branches that end with (2x2) and sub-matrices. Maybe when a node has multiple children, it combines their data into larger matrices? So for example, (3 (6, 4) (2x2) 4 [[1, 1], [1, 1]] ) might be combining four matrices of size 1x1 each into a 2x2 matrix filled with ones.

Putting this all together, it seems like the tree is defining how data flows and combines through different layers. Each node's children contribute to its own value or structure, especially when they merge multiple inputs into a larger output.

I'm still not entirely clear on the purpose, but I think each step processes some input (maybe vectors or matrices) according to the node's parameters and combines them accordingly using their sub-trees. The final matrix might represent the processed data after traversing all branches of the tree.

So, summarizing my thoughts: this is a recursive structure where each node defines how its children contribute to its own value, possibly by combining their results into larger matrices or aggregating some information based on given parameters like (10x10). The processing likely involves matrix operations and data aggregation as defined by each node's children.

I need to make sure that when processing the tree, I handle each subtree correctly according to these parameters. Maybe starting from the leaves and moving up, computing each node based on its child nodes' results. That way, the dependencies are resolved step by step, ensuring that all necessary data is available before a parent node can process it.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact mathematical operations here, like how (1x1) or (2x2) sizes affect the processing, but I think each size represents the dimensions of some matrix involved in the computation. The [[values]] at the end might be where the actual data is stored after processing all branches.

Overall, this seems to involve creating a tree of operations that manipulate and combine matrices based on predefined rules. Each node's structure dictates how its children contribute to its own output, whether by adding, averaging, concatenating, or something else with matrices.

I think I need to parse the input correctly, identify each subtree's components, compute them recursively, and then aggregate their results according to the parent node's specifications. This might involve setting up some kind of recursive function where each call processes a subtree and returns its computed value, which is then used by its parent.

The matrix sizes are crucial here. For example, when a node specifies (2x2), it expects four inputs from children that combine into this 2x2 structure. Each child might be contributing a part of the final matrix. So, I need to make sure each child's output matches the expected input dimensions for its parent.

I also notice that some nodes have larger numbers like 10 or 6 in their parameters (like (10x10)). These could represent the size of matrices being processed or maybe indices into a data structure. It might be necessary to map these correctly to ensure compatibility between children and parents.

Another point is the [[...]] part, which seems to hold the actual results after processing all branches. For instance, in (3 (6, 4) ...), there's a sub-tree that computes four matrices of size 1x1 each, leading up to a 2x2 matrix filled with ones. This suggests that when multiple child nodes contribute data, they are combined into a larger structure based on the parent node's parameters.

I'm still unclear about how exactly the numbers like (0, 3) or (1, 4) affect the processing of each subtree. Maybe these represent indices or specific operations to perform on their respective children's outputs before combining them in the parent node.

To break it down further, I could start by identifying all the leaves—nodes with no children—and compute their values first. Then move up one level and process each node using its children's computed values, following the rules specified in the node's parameters.

For example, if a leaf has some data [[1]], then moving up to its parent which might have (2x2) size, I would need to arrange these single-value matrices into the 2x2 structure. But I'm not sure how exactly that works since each child is contributing one value here.

Maybe each node's parameters indicate how many inputs it expects from its children and how to aggregate them. So a node with (3x3) size might expect nine inputs, perhaps from three children each providing three values? Or maybe each input represents an element in the matrix.

This requires careful analysis of how the tree is structured and what each parameter signifies. Without clear definitions on these operations, it's challenging to implement correctly.

I think the key steps are:
1. Parse the input tree structure.
2. Recursively process each subtree, computing their values based on parameters like size and sub-trees.
3. Combine child results according to parent node's specifications (e.g., matrix dimensions or aggregation rules).
4. Aggregate all processed data into the final output.

It might be helpful to write a parser that can handle nested tuples and extract the necessary information for each subtree, then apply the processing logic accordingly. Testing this with smaller trees first could also help verify if the approach is correct before tackling the entire input tree.
</think>

The input provided represents a hierarchical tree structure where each node processes its children according to specified parameters. Each node defines how its children contribute to its own value or structure, potentially by combining their results into larger matrices or aggregating information based on given dimensions.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Root Node Processing**:
   - The root node (0) has nine children. Each child is processed recursively.
   - Each subtree processes data according to the parameters provided in its structure, such as matrix sizes and sub-tree definitions.

2. **Recursive Processing**:
   - For each node, process its children first (a recursive approach).
   - For nodes with multiple children that contribute to a larger matrix (e.g., size 2x2), combine their results into the specified matrix dimensions.
   - Example: A node specifying (2x2) combines four child matrices of size 1x1 each into a single 2x2 matrix.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - When multiple children contribute to a parent's structure, they are combined according to the parent's parameters.
   - For instance, in the subtree `(6 (3, 0) ... (2x2) ...)`, four child matrices of size 1x1 are concatenated into a larger matrix.

4. **Final Aggregation**:
   - After processing all subtrees, combine their results to form the final output structure.
   - The final matrix represents the processed data after traversing all branches of the tree.

### Example Processing:

Consider the root node (0) with nine children:
- Each child is a subtree that processes its own parameters and combines results as needed.
- Nodes like `(2 (0, 3) ...)` process their immediate children, which may be leaves or further nested subtrees.
- Leaves are nodes without children, such as `[[1]]`, contributing simple values to their parent.

### Conclusion:

The tree is a recursive structure where each node's value depends on its children. Processing involves:
1. Recursively evaluating each subtree.
2. Combining child results according to the node's specified dimensions and parameters.
3. Aggregating all processed data into the final output matrix.

This approach ensures that each part of the input tree is correctly processed, respecting the hierarchical dependencies defined by the nodes' structure.
