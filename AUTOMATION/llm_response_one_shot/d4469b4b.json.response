User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the output tree is generated from the input tree in these examples. Let's look at the first train example.

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (5x5) 0 [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]] 
(2 (0,0) (5x5) 1 [[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0,1],[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]] 
(2 (4,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )) 

Output Tree:
(0 (0,0) (3x3) 0 [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]] 
5 (0,0) (3x3) 1 [[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]] ))

Hmm, so the input has a root node with value 0, two children. The first child is another node with value 2 and size 5x5, which contains some data. The second child is also value 2 but at position (4,4) in a 1x1 matrix.

The output seems to have the same structure: root value 0, then a node with value 5 and 3x3. I notice that the input's two children are processed somehow into this single child in the output. Maybe it's combining data from both branches?

Looking at the first train example's output tree, the main difference is that instead of having two nodes with value 2, now there's a node with value 5 and size 3x3. The data matrices also changed.

In the input matrix for the first branch:
[[0,1,0,1,0],
 [0,1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,1,0,0]]

And in the second branch (position 4,4):
[[1]]

The output matrix is:
[[1,1,1],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,1,0]]

I'm thinking that maybe the values from both branches are combined or averaged. For instance, taking the first elements of each input node and putting them together.

In the first branch's data, row 4 (index starting at 1) has a value of 1 in position 4, but wait, the second branch is a single cell [4,4] which is [[1]]. So maybe they are taking every nth element from each matrix to create the output.

Looking more closely, the first input's main matrix and the second branch's data. If we take rows or columns and combine them, perhaps by summing or taking maximums.

Wait, if I add corresponding elements of the two matrices:

First branch matrix:
Row 1: [0,1,0,1,0]
Second branch (at position 4) is [[1]], which would be at row 5. But since it's a single cell, maybe it adds to some part.

Wait, perhaps for each column, we're taking values from both branches and combining them into one value per column in the output.

Looking at the first train example input:

First branch matrix has columns like [0], [1], [0], [1], [0]. Second branch is [[1]] which would be placed at position (4,4). So maybe it's adding to the 5th column? Or perhaps they are interleaving or taking every other element.

Alternatively, since in the output matrix there are three columns instead of five, maybe we're reducing from 5x5 to 3x3. Maybe summing adjacent elements or taking maximums for each small block.

In the input first branch's data:

Row 1: [0,1,0,1,0]
If we take every two elements and sum:
(0+1) =1
(0+1)=1
(0+ something?) Maybe it's not that. Alternatively, taking specific columns.

Wait, in the output matrix first row is [1,1,1]. In input, rows have 0s and 1s. Perhaps we're summing elements from both branches for each cell.

But since the second branch only has a single value at position (4,4), which would be column 5? Maybe in row 5 of the first branch's matrix is [0,0,1,0,0], and adding that to something else?

I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: look for a pattern.

In the input, each node has some data. The output combines these into a single child with different dimensions. Perhaps it's taking the sum or maximum of corresponding positions across all children.

Looking at first branch matrix:
Row 1: [0,1,0,1,0]
Second branch matrix (only row 4): [[1]]

But in the output, each element is either 0,1, etc. Maybe for each position in the output, it's taking a combination of all input matrices at that position.

Wait, but the second branch only has one value at (4,4), which would be column 5? But in the output matrix, there are three columns, so perhaps they're selecting certain positions from both branches and combining them.

Alternatively, maybe the parent node's size is being adjusted. The input had a child of 5x5 and another of 1x1, but the output has a single child of 3x3.

Maybe the process involves averaging or summing based on some factor.

Another thought: perhaps each branch contributes to parts of the output matrix proportionally. For example, if there are two branches, maybe their contributions are split into the first and second third of the output's rows or columns.

Wait, let me think about the first train input:

The root has a value 0, with two children:
1) Value 2, size 5x5
2) Value 2, size 1x1 at position (4,4)

In the output, it becomes a single node with value 5 and size 3x3.

Perhaps each child contributes to part of the parent's data. For instance, maybe:

- The first branch is split into the top two-thirds of the rows.
- The second branch is added proportionally or averaged in some way.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since there are two children contributing, their matrices might be merged by taking averages or sums for each cell based on how many parents contribute to that cell.

Wait, if you have two children, maybe it's like a voting system where the parent takes values from both branches and combines them into one value per cell.

Alternatively, perhaps only certain cells are considered. For example, in position (1,1) of the first branch is 0, but position (4,4) in the second branch is 1. So maybe for each cell in the output, you take the sum or maximum from corresponding positions across all parents.

But since the parent nodes have different sizes and positions, it's tricky to align them.

Another idea: Maybe the value of the parent node is being calculated as a sum of its children's values plus some other operation. For example, 0 (parent) + 2 (first child) * something + 2 (second child) * something else =5. But that doesn't add up because 2+2=4, which isn't 5.

Wait, maybe the number of nodes is considered: each child contributes a certain amount to the parent's value based on their depth or position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how many children a node has and summing them. But in this case, first parent had two children contributing, resulting in value 5.

Maybe there's an aggregation step where multiple child nodes are combined into one with a new value. For example, if you have N children, the parent could be their sum or average multiplied by some factor to get 5.

In the first train input, two children: perhaps 2 + 2 =4, but output is 5. Maybe adding position information? The second child was at (4,4), which might contribute an offset.

Alternatively, maybe it's not about the sum but something else like the number of non-zero elements in the data matrices.

In the first branch matrix:
Row 1: [0,1,0,1,0] has two 1s
Row 2: [0,1,1,1,0] has three 1s
Row3: [0,1,1,0,1] has three 1s
Row4: [1,1,1,0,0] has three 1s
Row5: [0,0,1,0,0] has one 1

Total non-zero elements:2+3+3+3+1=12.

The second branch matrix is [[1]], which is another non-zero element. So total 13.

But the output first node's data is:
[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]] which has three rows and each row has two or three elements.

Wait, maybe it's about how these are aggregated per column across all parents. For example:

First parent contributes a 5x5 matrix, second parent is a single value at (4,4). So when merging, for each output cell, take the average from overlapping positions across inputs.

But since they don't align perfectly in size and position, it's difficult to see how that would result in a single node with 3x3 data.

Wait, perhaps it's about padding. Maybe both matrices are padded with zeros to match dimensions before combining, then summed or averaged. But 5x5 +1x1 is tricky unless the smaller one is padded to 5x5 and then some operations occur.

Alternatively, maybe the process involves taking only certain parts of each child's matrix.

Another angle: looking at how many parents contribute to a single output node. Each parent contributes based on their depth or position.

Wait, in this case, first root has two children contributing (each with value 2). So perhaps:

Parent value = sum of child values * something + some operation related to the number of children.

But 2+2=4; not matching 5.

Alternatively, parent's value could be the maximum of all child values plus their count or average. For two children each value 2: max is 2, count is 2; so 2 + (something) =5?

Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's about how many nodes in total contribute to a single node. The root has one node; its children have two. Maybe the parent's value is some function of its number of children and their values.

But I'm not getting anywhere concrete.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the position of the second child. It was at (4,4). So maybe 4+4=8, but how does that relate to 5? Maybe modulo or something else.

Wait, another thought: in neural networks, sometimes multiple inputs are combined into a single output using sum or average with weights. Maybe each parent node's value is multiplied by a weight based on their position and then summed.

But since both parents here have value 2, maybe 2 * w1 + 2* w2 =5.

If that's the case, what could be w1 and w2? For example:

w1=0.5, w2=1.75: but not sure where these weights come from.

Alternatively, if each parent contributes based on their depth or position in the tree.

Wait, perhaps it's about how many nodes are in a path leading to that child. Or maybe something related to binary representations.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the number of children affects the value: since first root has two children (each with value 2), then parent is 5=2*2 +1 or some other function.

But still unclear.

Perhaps I should look for another pattern in other parts.

In the output matrix:
Row1: [1,1,1]
Row2: [0,1,0]
Row3: [0,1,0]

It's a 3x3 matrix. The top row is all 1s except maybe zeros elsewhere? Wait, but from where?

Looking at the first branch's data:

Original:5 rows and columns.

If we assume that for output matrix of size 3x3, perhaps only certain positions are taken from each parent.

Alternatively, since the two parents have different sizes (5x5 and1x1), maybe their contributions are scaled or combined in a way to fit into 3x3.

Wait, perhaps it's an average:

Each cell is either 0 or 1. Maybe the output is taking the maximum from each corresponding position across all parents after padding with zeros to match size.

But since two parents have different sizes, how would that work?

Alternatively, maybe they're using a different approach: for example, in first parent's matrix (5x5), perhaps only rows and columns 1-3 are taken into account. So from row1-3, column1-3:

First branch data:
Row1: [0,1,0]
Row2: [0,1,1]
Row3: [0,1,1]

If we take max or sum per cell with the second parent's contribution.

Second parent is at (4,4) which would be outside the first 3x3 area, so perhaps that doesn't contribute to the output. So maybe:

For each cell in 3x3 matrix of output:
- Take value from first branch if it exists, else 0
- Take average or sum with other contributions

But since only one parent's data contributes (the rest are outside), but then how does that lead to [1,1,1; 0,1,0; etc.]? Maybe some weighting is applied.

Wait, maybe the value in each output cell is equal to the number of parents contributing a non-zero value at that position. But since only first branch contributes from row1-3, column1-3, which has certain non-zero values:

Row1: [0,1,0]
Row2: [0,1,1]
Row3: [0,1,1]

If we count how many parents have a 1 in each position. Since only first branch contributes (the second parent is at row4, column4 which doesn't affect the output), then for positions where there are non-zero values, it's just 1.

But the output has some cells with value 0 and others with 1.

Wait, perhaps that approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe each output cell is a sum of contributions from all parents, scaled somehow. But since second parent contributes only at row4,column4 which doesn't affect output, so it's irrelevant here.

But I'm stuck on how to get from the first branch's 5x5 matrix (with non-zero in certain cells) to the 3x3 output with specific values.

Wait, maybe it's about max pooling. In neural networks, max pooling takes the maximum value in a region. So if you take max of each 2x2 block or something?

But for a 5x5 matrix, taking max of 2x2 blocks would give 4x4 output, not 3x3.

Alternatively, maybe using some other pooling function like average.

If first parent's data is:

Row1:0,1,0,...

Then row2:0,1,1,...

row3:0,1,1...

row4:..., etc. but in the output only rows1-3 are considered?

Wait, maybe it's down-sampling or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each value is incremented based on how many parents contribute to that cell. But as second parent doesn't affect here, so same as first branch.

But again, not matching the values.

I'm stuck here; maybe I need to think of another approach.

Another idea: if it's about combining the two parent nodes' data into a single node via some operation like addition or multiplication with weights. For example:

Value = (2 * w1) + (2 * w2)

If that equals 5, then we can have 2w1 + 2w2=5.

But without knowing more about the weights, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe each parent contributes a value based on their depth or position. For example:

First child is at level 1 (distance from root), so weight = something, second child also at level1, same weight.

Wait, but again no idea.

Another thought: perhaps it's about the number of children. The first node has two children contributing with value2 each; maybe parent value=children sum + number_of_children.

So 2+2+2=6? Not matching5.

Or parent = sum(children) - something.

Wait, if I take the maximum child value: max(2,2)=2, then add depth or something. Root is at level1, so maybe 2 + (level-1)*something.

But no clear path.

Alternatively, maybe it's about XOR operation. 2 XOR 3=1? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps each parent contributes a value based on their own position in the tree.

For first child, if it is at depth d1, then its contribution is c1 = f(d1). Similarly for second child, c2=f(d2).

Then parent's value could be some function of these contributions. But without knowing how to combine them, unsure.

Wait, let me think about the number 5 in relation to the parents' values: two children each with 2. Maybe it's like 2 + (2*1) =4? Not enough. Or 2+2=4, but 4 vs5.

Alternatively, maybe they are combined with weights based on their positions:

For example, if first child is at position (x,y), weight w1; second at (p,q), weight w2.

Then parent value= c1*w1 +c2*w2 =5

But without knowing the exact positions or how to compute weights, it's too vague.

Wait, maybe each parent contributes based on their depth. If they are both children of root, same level; so perhaps something like 2*number_of_children + some constant.

If number_of_children=2: then 2*2=4, but we need5. Hmm.

Alternatively, 2^children_count =2^2=4 again not enough.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of nodes in a layer or something else.

Another angle: think about each parent node having multiple contributions, and sum them with weights to get the child value.

But without more data on how this process works, difficult to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the value is based on some binary operation. For example:

2 XOR 3 =1; but not relevant here as both are 2s.

Wait, maybe it's about treating each parent node's value as a vector and combining them via an operation. But unclear.

I'm stuck here because I don't know the exact rules used to combine child nodes into parent nodes. Maybe if more information was provided on how the values from children contribute to their parent, but as per current knowledge, it's difficult to model.

Perhaps 5 is just a result of some formula involving 2 and another factor, like 2*2 +1=5? Not sure where that would come from though.

Wait, maybe if each child contributes an array or something, which when combined (like element-wise addition) forms the parent's value. But without knowing how to combine arrays, can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps treating node values as weights in a graph and propagating them; but again, unclear.

In summary, I don't have enough information on the exact rules for combining child nodes into their parent to determine why 5 is derived from two children with value2 each. More context or details about the combination process would be needed to figure this out.
</think>

To explain how the value **5** is derived from two child nodes, each having a value of **2**, we need to understand the specific rules used in their combination. Since the provided information doesn't specify these rules, here's an example scenario:

**Example Combination Process:**

1. **Child Nodes:** Two children with values of **2** each.
2. **Combination Formula:** Parent value = (Sum of child values) + (Depth × 1)
   - If both children are at depth **1**, then:
     \[
     \text{Parent value} = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
     \]
   
In this example, the parent node's value is calculated as the sum of its child values plus a factor based on its depth. This results in a parent value of **5**.

**Final Answer:**

The parent node's value of **5** could be derived using a combination formula that includes both child values and a depth-based factor, such as:
\[
\boxed{5 = 2 + 2 + 1}
\]
