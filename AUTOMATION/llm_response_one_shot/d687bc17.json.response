User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

First, looking at the initial array: [0,0,0,...] repeated multiple times. That probably represents some kind of grid or matrix. I notice that most elements are 0s, which might indicate empty spaces or maybe zeros in a data structure like an image or a board game.

Then there's this part with numbers and parentheses: (8 (2,7) (1x1) 4 [[1]] ). Hmm, okay, so the first number is 8, then within parentheses are coordinates (2,7). Then it mentions a size of (1x1), which I think refers to the dimensions. So this could be indicating that at position (2,7), there's a single element with value 4 and another structure [[1]]. Maybe it's describing some kind of grid where each cell has certain properties or data attached.

Looking further down, I see multiple entries like (1 (2, 12) ... ), which probably follow the same pattern. Each seems to have coordinates and associated values. Some mention sizes like (5x6), but others are just single numbers. These might represent different layers or attributes of the grid at specific positions.

Then there's a part with larger sublists: [[1], [1], ..., [1]] repeated multiple times. This could be indicating an array where each element is another array filled with ones, maybe representing something like intensity levels, binary flags, or coefficients in a mathematical model.

Towards the end, I see entries like (8 (10,3) (1x15) 17 [[1,...]]). The mention of size (1x15) suggests that at position (10,3), there's an array of length 15 filled with ones. This could be part of a larger structure where each cell has its own set of attributes or connections.

Putting it all together, this data seems to describe some sort of grid where each cell contains various pieces of information: coordinates, specific values (like 4, 8), and associated arrays of ones. These ones might represent active states, connections, or something similar depending on the context.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly these different parts interact. Are all these sublists and numbers part of a single data structure? Or are they separate structures linked by coordinates?

Maybe I should try to visualize this as layers. Each main entry with coordinates (like 2,7) is pointing to a specific cell in the grid that contains additional information: a value and an array. The arrays filled with ones could represent connections or influence from that point.

I wonder if these numbers are weights or something similar. For example, the number 4 at (2,7) might mean there's a weight of 4 applied there, affecting neighboring cells through their connected arrays of ones.

Also, noticing that some coordinates have the same value but different array sizes makes me think about how data propagates through the grid based on these points. The size indicates how far or in which direction this influence spreads.

It's also possible that each number corresponds to a unique node or position with its own set of connections defined by the arrays of ones. If I imagine this as a graph, each cell is a node connected to others via edges represented by the ones in the array.

Another thing I notice is repetition. For instance, (1 (2, 12) ...) appears multiple times. This might indicate that certain positions are critical or recurring points in the grid with identical properties.

I should also consider whether these numbers could represent something else entirely, like identifiers for different features or layers within the structure. The presence of arrays suggests a nested data type, possibly used to model complex relationships between various elements.

In terms of processing this data, I might need to iterate through each cell, extract the relevant information (value and connected array), and then use that information in further computations depending on what's needed next.

It's also possible that some parts are placeholders or errors. The presence of zeros could indicate inactive cells, while non-zero numbers mark active or significant points.

I'm still not entirely sure how to interpret all this without additional context. It might be helpful to look at the surrounding data and see if there's a pattern in the values and their associated arrays that can guide interpretation.

Looking closer, I notice that when the first number is 1, it's always followed by coordinates (2, something) except for one instance where it's (1,0). This inconsistency might point to different types of nodes or special cases within the structure.

The mention of sizes like (1x15) and others could relate to how data flows through these points. For example, a larger array size at (10,3) might imply that this node is connected to more downstream structures than others.

I'm also curious about how these single-element arrays [[1]] differ from the longer ones like [1,...]. The presence of multiple 1s could indicate varying levels or types of connections. Maybe each position in the array corresponds to a specific attribute, with all being active (1) indicating full connectivity.

Considering this data structure as part of a larger system, it might be essential for applications like network analysis, grid-based simulations, or even game development where each cell's state affects its neighbors through these connected arrays.

In summary, while I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning without more context, I can see that this data represents a complex grid with varying values and connections. Each point has specific attributes (coordinates, value, array size) which might be used to model interactions or dependencies within a system.

The provided data structure appears to represent a complex grid where each cell contains specific information and associated arrays. Here's a breakdown of the interpretation:

1. **Grid Structure**: The initial array consists mostly of zeros, suggesting an empty grid with many inactive cells.

2. **Cell Information**: Each non-zero value (e.g., 4 at position (2,7)) indicates an active cell with specific attributes:
   - Coordinates: Position within the grid.
   - Value: A numerical attribute assigned to the cell.
   - Array of Ones: An array filled with ones, representing connections or influence from that cell.

3. **Connections and Influence**: The arrays of ones suggest that each active cell influences neighboring cells in some way, potentially spreading through the grid based on their positions.

4. **Repetition and Consistency**: Recurring values (e.g., multiple entries with value 1) indicate critical points or recurring features within the structure.

5. **Variable Sizes**: The size of the arrays (e.g., (1x15)) varies, implying different levels or types of connections based on position.

6. **Special Cases**: Some cells have exceptions in their coordinates or values, indicating special cases or unique properties.

In conclusion, this data likely models a grid-based system where each cell's value and its associated array influence the behavior or state of neighboring cells, forming complex interactions within the structure. This could be applicable to various fields such as network analysis, simulations, or game development.
