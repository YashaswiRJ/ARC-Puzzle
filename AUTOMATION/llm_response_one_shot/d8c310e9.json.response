User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this tree is structured and what the input means. Let me start by breaking down the first example provided.

The user gave a test case with an input tree that starts with (0 (0, 0) (5x15) 0 ...). It looks like each node in the tree has several components: a label, two children which are nodes themselves or leaves, a size multiplier, and sometimes some data attached.

In the first example's output, I see it's built using these nodes with labels followed by their left and right subtrees. The numbers in parentheses after 0 seem to be parameters for each node. For instance, (5x15) probably refers to a size of 5 multiplied by 15, giving a total of 75 elements or something similar.

Looking at the structure, it starts with 0 as the root, which has two children: another 0 and a [0s array]. The first child is (2 (4, 14) ...), which might be a subtree with label 2 having parameters 4 and 14. Then the next part branches into multiple nodes like (3 (3,1)...), each of which has their own children.

I'm noticing that some parts have numbers in square brackets, which I think represent data arrays or vectors attached to the nodes. For example, after label 0's right child is [[0,0,...], [0,0,...], ... five times]. Each bracketed part seems to be a vector of zeros with length 15.

Then there are other parts like (2 (4, 2) ...), which have their own data arrays. The numbers before each node's parentheses might indicate something about the structure—maybe dimensions or sizes.

In the test example, it starts similarly but with different parameters and data structures. For instance, after the initial 0, the children are a [0s array], (2...6), then several nodes like 3, 4, etc., each with their own data arrays and subtree structures.

I think the goal is to parse these trees correctly, ensuring that each node's parameters align with its structure. The numbers before parentheses might represent something like dimensions or counts for how many children a node can have or how much data it processes.

The user mentioned an input tree: (0 ...). So perhaps they want me to process this given structure and produce the correct output, which is another tree in this specific format with labels and sub-structures as shown in their examples.

I need to make sure that when building each subtree, I correctly handle the data arrays attached at each node. Also, ensuring that branches are correctly expanded from each parent node according to their defined parameters (like 5x15 meaning 5 multiplied by 15 or something similar).

I should also be cautious with zero-based indexing in the indices within these vectors because the output trees seem to use [0,0,...] which suggests an array starting at index 0.

Overall, my approach will be:

1. Parse each node's structure from left to right.
2. For each label and its parameters (like size multipliers), generate the appropriate subtree structure.
3. Attach data arrays as specified in each node's definition.
4. Ensure that when branches are created, they are correctly nested according to their parent nodes.

I might need to write functions that recursively build these trees based on the given parameters. Each function call would handle one node and its children, constructing the tree step by step while keeping track of indices or structures as needed.

Potential challenges include correctly interpreting the size multipliers and ensuring that data arrays are consistently applied across similar nodes. I'll also need to verify that all branches are properly closed and nested without overlapping incorrectly.

Testing each part incrementally could help catch any mistakes, especially with how children subtrees branch off from parent nodes at different levels of depth.

The problem involves parsing and constructing a tree based on the given input structure. Each node in the tree has parameters such as labels, sizes, multipliers, data arrays, and subtree definitions.

**Approach:**

1. **Recursive Parsing:** Use recursion to traverse the tree, processing each node and its subtrees.
2. **Parameter Handling:** Extract size and multiplier parameters from each node's definition to determine the structure of the subtrees.
3. **Data Array Attachment:** Attach data arrays to nodes as specified in their definitions.
4. **Branching Structure:** Ensure that each node's children are correctly defined, maintaining the correct nesting and order.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Parse the Input Tree:** Convert the input string into a tree structure with nodes containing labels, parameters, subtrees, and data arrays.
2. **Generate Subtrees Recursively:**
   - For each node, recursively generate its left and right subtrees based on size and multiplier values.
3. **Build Data Arrays:** Create appropriate vectors or lists for the data attached to each node according to the given examples.

**Example Tree Construction:**

Starting with the root node labeled 0:
- The root has two children: a leaf array of zeros and another subtree (label 2).
   - Label 2's subtree is processed recursively, generating its own left and right subtrees.
      - This continues until all nodes are processed according to their definitions.

**Final Tree Structure:**

The constructed tree will replicate the structure seen in both examples, with each node correctly defined by its parameters and attached data arrays. The exact output format mirrors the provided examples, ensuring consistency across labels and nested structures.

```plaintext
[
  {
    label: "0",
    children: [
      {
        label: "0",
        children: [
          [],
          "data"
        ]
      },
      "data"
    ]
  }
]
```

This approach ensures that each node's structure is accurately represented, maintaining the integrity of the tree hierarchy and data associations.
