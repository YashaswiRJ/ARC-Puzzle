User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]

-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've been given this problem where there's a tree structure with nodes that have attributes. The goal is to determine whether two trees are isomorphic, which means they have the same structure but possibly different node labels.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like each node in the tree has an attribute value (like 0 or numbers) and a count of children nodes with that exact attribute value. So, for example, if a node is labeled '0', it might have two children also labeled '0'.

Looking at the user's provided test case, there are two trees: one from the first input and another from the second input. The output tree seems to be showing some kind of mapping or transformation between these nodes.

I think I should break this down step by step. First, parse each tree into its constituent parts—nodes with their attributes and the count of children that share those attributes. Then, compare the structure recursively: check if two parent nodes have corresponding children in the same order (in terms of attribute values) and recursively verify each child.

Wait, but I also need to consider whether the trees are isomorphic regardless of the labels as long as the structure aligns when considering their attribute counts. So maybe a better approach would be to assign unique identifiers based on the path from the root or something like that, ensuring that nodes with the same attributes and similar child structures receive the same identifier.

Another thought: perhaps using a hashing method where each node's hash is determined by its attribute value combined with the hashes of its children in order. This way, two nodes are considered identical if their hashes match, which would imply they have the same structure and attribute counts as their corresponding children.

But I'm not entirely sure how to implement this correctly. Maybe start by writing a function that generates a unique identifier for each node based on its attributes and the identifiers of its children in order. Then, compare these identifiers between nodes in both trees to check for isomorphism.

I should also consider edge cases: what if one tree has more nodes than the other? Or if their structures diverge early on?

Additionally, I need to make sure that when comparing child nodes, they are ordered correctly. For example, node A's first child with attribute '1' must correspond to node B's first child with attribute '1', and so on.

Hmm, maybe a breadth-first or depth-first comparison would work here, traversing both trees simultaneously and checking at each step if the current node in tree A matches the corresponding node in tree B based on their attributes and hashed identifiers of their children.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating this. Perhaps there's a simpler way to traverse both trees and map nodes accordingly without getting into too much complexity with hashing. Maybe just comparing each parent along with its immediate children in order until all are matched or discrepancies are found.

I think the key is ensuring that for every node, we can find a corresponding node in the other tree with the same attribute value, and their respective child structures also match. This recursive check should ensure isomorphism.

So, to summarize my approach:

1. Parse both trees into structured data representations.
2. Traverse each tree simultaneously using BFS or DFS.
3. At each step, check if the current node in both trees has the same attribute value.
4. For each node, collect a list of identifiers for its immediate children (based on their attributes) and compare these lists between corresponding nodes in both trees.
5. If all levels match successfully without discrepancies, the trees are isomorphic.

I should also think about how to represent the nodes. Maybe as objects with an 'attr' attribute and a list of child nodes. Then, each node can generate a signature that includes its attr value and the sorted (or in order) signatures of its children.

Wait, but I need to maintain the order of children because their attributes determine the structure. So, it's not just about having the same attributes as their counterparts but also the sequence.

Alternatively, using Merkle hashing for each node could work. Each node's hash is computed based on its attribute and a sorted list (or some function) of its children's hashes in order. If two nodes have the same attribute and produce the same hash after considering their children, they are considered identical, contributing to tree isomorphism.

This seems more accurate but also more computationally intensive due to the hashing step for each node during traversal.

Another consideration: what about root attributes? The root must be the only one with no parent. So, in both trees, the root nodes should have matching attribute values and their children's structure as per the rules above.

Let me try applying this logic to a simple example:

Suppose Tree A has a root node '0' with two children '1', each of which is a leaf (no further children). Tree B also has a root '0' with two children '1'. These should be isomorphic because their structures are the same.

Now, if Tree C has a root '1' and its child is '0', while Tree D has a root '0' and child '1', these trees shouldn't be isomorphic since their roots have different attributes despite having similar child structures.

So, during traversal, when comparing the root nodes, we first check that both are '0' (in this case). Then, for each of their children in order, we ensure they match as well. If any mismatch occurs, we return false; otherwise, true.

Wait, but what if one tree has a node with attribute '1' and zero children, while the other has no such node? Then, during traversal, this would result in mismatched structure early on, correctly identifying that they aren't isomorphic.

I think this approach will cover most cases. Now, how do I implement this?

Perhaps recursively:

- Check if both trees are None: return True.
- Check root attributes; if different, return False.
- For each tree, get the list of children's identifiers (based on their attributes) in order.
- Compare these lists to ensure they have the same length and that corresponding elements match when checked against each other.

Wait, but this doesn't account for child node structure beyond their immediate attribute. So perhaps I need a more detailed comparison, including hashing or some form of canonical representation for each subtree rooted at a particular node.

Alternatively, using memoization to store computed hashes could help in efficiently verifying isomorphism by ensuring that structurally identical subtrees have the same hash value.

Yes, this seems promising. Each node can compute its unique hash based on its attribute and the sorted (or ordered) hashes of its immediate children. Then, two trees are isomorphic if their root nodes' hashes are equal.

But I need to be careful about how the child hashes are combined because simply sorting them might not preserve order correctly. Wait, no—because each node's hash depends on the attributes and the exact sequence of child hashes. So even if two subtrees have children with the same attribute values but in different orders, their hashes would still differ.

Therefore, perhaps we should collect the list of child hashes for each node in a specific order (based on the attribute values) to ensure that nodes are matched correctly when traversing both trees.

Wait, maybe it's better not to sort the children. Instead, preserve the order as per their attribute or some other defined criteria because the structure must match exactly based on the sequence of attributes and child structures.

This might complicate things a bit but is necessary for correctness.

So, for each node:

1. If both nodes are None: return True.
2. Compare root attributes; if different, return False.
3. For each tree, collect the hashes of immediate children in order (without sorting).
4. Check that the lists have the same length and that corresponding elements are isomorphic.

But how do I get these hashes? Maybe recursively compute them for each node as we traverse both trees simultaneously.

Alternatively, perform a BFS or DFS traversal where at each step, we process nodes level by level, comparing their attributes and ensuring their children's structures match in order.

I think the latter approach might be more manageable. Let me outline it:

- Traverse Tree A and Tree B using the same traversal method (e.g., BFS).
- For each node pair from both trees at the current level:
   - Compare their attribute values.
   - Collect the hashes of their immediate children in order for comparison.
   - If any attribute mismatch or child structure mismatch, return False.

But to compute these child hashes, I need a way to uniquely represent each subtree. This is where Merkle hashing comes into play—each node's hash depends on its attribute and the hashes of its children in order.

Therefore, during traversal:

1. Start with root nodes.
2. For each node:
   - Compute its hash based on its attribute value and the sorted (or ordered) list of child hashes.
3. Compare the root hashes to determine isomorphism.

Wait, but computing this recursively might not be straightforward without memoization or caching the computed hashes for each subtree.

Another thought: perhaps during traversal, as we visit nodes in both trees, we can cache their hash values so that if the same node attribute and children structure are encountered again, we don't recompute it. This would optimize the process but is more complex to implement due to handling memoization across different tree traversals.

Alternatively, compute all hashes for each tree during a BFS traversal in one pass, storing them as you go. Then, compare these hashes between corresponding nodes in both trees.

But this approach requires that we traverse both trees synchronously and simultaneously at the same level before moving deeper into their structures.

Putting it all together:

1. Check if either tree is None while the other isn't. If so, return False.
2. Start BFS traversal from both roots.
3. For each node pair in the current BFS level:
   - Compare their attribute values. If different, return False.
   - Collect the list of child hashes for each node (from Tree A and Tree B).
   - Check if the two lists are isomorphic by comparing each corresponding element recursively using their child hashes.

Wait, but how do I compare if two lists of hashes are isomorphic? Because it's possible that different structures could have the same hash values due to collisions in the hashing function. However, with a good cryptographic hash, this probability should be negligible for practical purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a more precise method like tree serialization or using unique identifiers based on subtree structure.

But given time constraints and assuming standard practice, maybe using Merkle hashes is acceptable.

So, during traversal:

- For each node in both trees:
   - Compute its hash as (attribute, tuple of child hashes)) for Tree A.
   - Similarly compute the hash for corresponding nodes in Tree B.
   - Compare the root hashes to determine if they are identical. If yes, then return True; else, False.

But wait, since it's a tree comparison, not just single node hashing, we need to ensure that all nodes at each level have matching attributes and child structures. So, perhaps performing BFS traversal where:

- We process nodes level by level.
- For each level, compare the current set of node hashes from both trees.

If any mismatch occurs in either attribute or hash structure (i.e., sequence of child hashes), return False. Otherwise, proceed to the next level until all nodes are processed.

This seems like a solid approach but implementing it requires careful handling during traversal and comparison at each level.

Potential steps:

1. Check if both trees have the same number of levels. If not, return False.
2. For each level from root down:
   - Collect hashes of current nodes in Tree A and Tree B.
   - Compare these two lists for equality. If they differ, return False.
3. If all levels match, return True.

This approach ensures that each node at every level has a matching attribute and child structure with the corresponding node in the other tree.

But how do I represent this hashing? Each node's hash is based on its attribute value and the tuple of hashes from its children, ordered according to their appearance in the tree.

Therefore:

- For Tree A: Traverse each node at level k, compute a hash for it as h = (attr, (child1_hash, child2_hash, ...)), where child hashes are already computed.
- Similarly for Tree B.

Wait, but this is recursive. So perhaps during traversal, we can process nodes in BFS order and store their computed hashes. Then, when comparing level by level, the hash list would match only if both trees have identical structures at that level.

But how to handle varying numbers of children? Each node may have a different number of children, so the tuple length will vary unless they are padded or accounted for in some way.

Hmm, perhaps this is where using Merkle hashes gets tricky. If two subtrees have different numbers of children but produce identical hash tuples due to hashing all their child hashes and the root attribute, it might cause issues.

Wait no—if both trees have nodes with attributes such that their combined hash matches despite having a different number of children, then the comparison would mistakenly think they are isomorphic when they're not. Therefore, perhaps padding or ensuring consistent tuple lengths is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps during traversal, for each node in Tree A and Tree B at corresponding levels:

1. If one tree has more nodes than the other at that level: return False.
2. For all nodes at this level:
   a. Compare their attribute values; if any differ, return False.
   b. Collect the list of child hashes (from both trees) in order and compare them as tuples.

So during BFS traversal:

- At each level k:
   - Collect all current node attributes from Tree A: list_a.
   - Collect all current node attributes from Tree B: list_b.
   - If len(list_a) != len(list_b): return False.
   - Compare list_a and list_b for equality. If not, return False.

But this only checks the attribute values of nodes at each level but doesn't compare their child structures unless we also compare the children's hashes in order.

Wait a minute—maybe my initial thought is insufficient because even if two trees have identical node attributes per level but different child structures within those levels, they would still fail. So perhaps during BFS traversal:

At each level k:

   For Tree A and Tree B:
      - Collect all current nodes' attribute values.
      - Compute their hashes based on attributes and children.

But it's unclear how to compute the hash for a node without knowing its children's structure.

Perhaps an alternative approach is needed. Let me think differently.

Maybe the problem can be approached by using serialization techniques that uniquely represent each subtree, then comparing these serialized strings or hashed values between corresponding nodes in both trees.

For example:

1. Perform a pre-order traversal of Tree A, generating a string like "attr_value child1_serialization child2_serialization..." and store it as a key for the node.
2. Do the same for Tree B.
3. Compare these serialized strings for each corresponding node at every level in both trees.

If all serialized strings match exactly across all levels, then the trees are isomorphic.

This approach should work because identical structures would produce identical serialization outputs regardless of the specific attributes used (as long as they're consistent).

So here's how it can be implemented:

- For Tree A:
   - Traverse each node level by level using BFS.
   - For each node at a given level, serialize its attribute value followed by the serialized strings of its children in order.

Wait no—this would involve nested serializations, which could get complicated. Instead, perhaps perform a post-order traversal for serialization.

But wait—no, because for comparison, it's better to have consistent levels with corresponding nodes having similar attributes and child structures.

Alternatively, think about using the Breadth-First Search approach where we compare node by node at each level:

1. Check if both trees have the same number of levels (depth). If not, return False.
2. For each level from 0 to max_level -1:
   a. Get all nodes at this level in Tree A: list_a.
   b. Get all nodes at this level in Tree B: list_b.
   c. Check if the number of nodes in list_a and list_b are equal. If not, return False.
   d. Compare each node's attribute value in list_a with corresponding in list_b. If any mismatch, return False.
3. Once all levels have been processed without mismatches, return True.

This approach would only check for identical attributes per level but does it ensure that the child structures are the same?

No. Because even if two trees have node attributes matching at each level, their children's structure could be different and yet not affect the level-wise comparison since they might all share similar attributes regardless of actual relationships.

Wait—this seems insufficient because it doesn't account for how nodes are connected. For example:

Tree A:
       1
     /   \
    2     3

Tree B:
       1
      /  
    4   
   /    
  2     
 /     
 3    

In this case, the BFS level-by-level comparison would pass because each node at level 0 has attribute 1, and each node at level 1 in both trees have attributes 2 and 3. But their structures are different.

Wait no—the second tree actually:

- Level 0: [1]
- Level 1: [4, ...]?
No—it depends on how the children are arranged. The example above isn't quite correct because Tree B has only one child of node 1 at level 1 (node 4), while in Tree A node 1 has two children.

So, during BFS traversal:

- At each level k: For both trees, collect all nodes' attributes.
   - If the count doesn't match or any attribute differs, return False.

But this approach would not catch structural differences because it only compares attributes and not how those nodes are connected. So even if two trees have same node attributes per level but different connections between them, this method wouldn't detect that.

Therefore, perhaps an alternative approach is needed to ensure both the attributes and the child structure match at each level.

An alternative idea is to compute a hash for each subtree rooted at a node. If we can generate identical hashes for nodes in corresponding positions within both trees, then they are isomorphic.

This way:

1. Compute a hash for each node's attribute along with the sorted hashes of its children (to account for order).
2. For Tree A and Tree B:
   - Traverse each level using BFS.
   - For each node at position k in list_a, compute its subtree hash and store it in a dictionary keyed by their positions.
3. Compare these computed hashes between corresponding nodes.

Wait, but that seems complex because the same attribute value might correspond to different children structures elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps use memoization or recursion with hashing:

- For each node, compute its "canonical form" as (attribute_value, tuple of sorted canonical forms of children). Then compare if for all nodes at each level in Tree A and Tree B, their canonical forms are identical.

But I'm not sure how to implement this correctly. It's getting complicated.

Maybe a better approach is:

1. For both trees, perform BFS traversal level by level.
2. For each level k:
   a. Collect all node attributes for the nodes at level k in Tree A and Tree B.
   b. If len of list_a != len of list_b: return False
   c. Check if every corresponding node's attribute is equal between list_a and list_b. If any mismatch, return False.
3. Additionally, ensure that each child subtree structure corresponds correctly.

Wait but this step 3 is tricky because it requires knowing the children positions.

Perhaps an alternative approach inspired by determining if two trees are structurally identical:

1. Check if both trees have the same number of levels (depth). If not, return False.
2. For BFS traversal:
   a. Enqueue root nodes from each tree.
   b. While queues are not empty:
      i. Dequeue nodes u and v from their respective queues.
      ii. Compare attributes: if u.attr != v.attr, return False
      iii. If either of u or v has children but the other doesn't, return False
      iv. Enqueue all children of u in order to the first queue
3. If all checks pass, trees are isomorphic.

Wait—this approach compares nodes level by level and ensures that each node's attribute matches as well as their child subtrees have corresponding structures.

Yes! This seems promising because it enforces a strict structural match at each step. So here's how this can be implemented:

- Implement BFS for both trees in parallel.
   - For each step, take the next nodes from each tree.
   - If attributes don't match, return False
   - Check if number of children are equal: else False (since same-level nodes must have matching number of children)
   - Enqueue all children to their respective queues.

This method ensures that both trees not only have identical structures but also the same attribute values at each node and in the correct order for the child subtrees.

So applying this to our problem:

Given two tree structures, we can perform a level-wise BFS traversal, comparing attributes at each step. If any mismatch occurs or if the number of children doesn't match between nodes at any level, then they are not isomorphic.

Now, considering that in the user's query, he mentioned something about using `get()` with default values:

Looking back, the initial approach was to use `get()` for tree traversal, but later changed to BFS. So perhaps integrating this idea into the provided code would help.

So here's a plan for the Python function:

Implement a function that takes two trees (as children dictionaries), and performs a level-wise comparison using BFS queues:

1. Check if both trees have at least one root node.
   - If not, return True because empty trees are considered isomorphic
2. Initialize queues with roots of each tree.
3. While queues are not empty:
   a. Get current nodes from each queue (u and v)
   b. Compare their attributes: if u.attr != v.attr → return False
   c. If either has children but the other doesn't, or number of children don't match→ return False
   d. Enqueue all children of u into first queue, same for v.
4. If loop completes without issues→ return True.

Wait—so the key is that when you dequeue nodes from each tree's BFS, they must have the same attributes and same number of children, and their children are enqueued in order.

This will ensure a one-to-one correspondence at each level, hence making the trees isomorphic if all checks pass.

Let me test this logic with some examples:

Example 1: Same structure but different attribute values → should return False
   Tree A:
       1
     /   \
    2     3
Tree B:
       4
     /   \
    5     6
In BFS step, nodes at level 0 (1 and 4) have same attributes? No. So function returns False.

Example 2: Same structure with some matching attributes → may not be enough unless all are matched.
Wait no—if one node has attribute A and the other B, they would mismatch during comparison.

Another example where two subtrees' children's order is different but structures are similar:

Tree A:
       1
     /   \
    2     3

Tree B:
       1
     /  
    4   
   /     
  2     
 /     
 3    

In this case, during BFS step: level 0 has node 1 in both trees → okay. Level 1 nodes are 2 and 3 in A; but in B's children of 1 is [4]. So number of children differs—so function returns False.

Thus, the approach correctly handles differing structures or attribute values.

So now, let me outline the steps for implementing this:

First, implement BFS queues. Each queue will hold nodes level by level.

For each tree, starting with their root node(s). For empty trees (both are empty), return True; if one is empty and other isn't, return False.

In code terms:

def are_isomorphic(tree1, tree2):
    from collections import deque

    # Handle case where both are None
    if not tree1 and not tree2:
        return True
    if not tree1 or not tree2:
        return False

    queue1 = deque([tree1])
    queue2 = deque([tree2])

    while queue1 and queue2:
        u = queue1.popleft()
        v = queue2.popleft()

        # Compare attributes (assuming they are comparable like int, str)
        if u != v:
            return False

        # Check number of children
        num_children1 = len(u['children'])
        num_children2 = len(v['children'])

        if num_children1 != num_children2:
            return False

        # Enqueue all children in order
        for child_u, child_v in zip(u['children'], v['children']):
            queue1.append(child_u)
            queue2.append(child_v)

    # All checks passed
    return True

Wait—wait, but in the user's code example, he's using a different approach:

He used get methods with default values. So perhaps his initial idea was to represent trees as nested dictionaries.

For example:
Tree1 = {'attr': 1, 'children': [{'attr':2}, {'attr':3}]}
Tree2 = same structure → they are isomorphic.

But in the code he wrote:

def get_children(tree):
    return tree.get('children', [])

Is that the case? So trees can be represented as dictionaries where each node has a key 'children' (which maps to its children) and possibly other keys like 'attr'.

Wait, but perhaps I need to make sure during traversal.

So in code:

We have two functions: one to get root nodes (could be None or some default), then for the tree structure.

But wait, in the function as written by the user, he uses .get() with 'children' and others. So probably the trees are dictionaries where each node is a dictionary with keys 'attr', 'children'.

Hence, during BFS traversal:

- Dequeue nodes u (from queue1) and v (from queue2)
   - If either doesn't have an 'attr' key → error? Or perhaps it's considered that if they don't exist, but in the context of isomorphic trees, their structures must match.

Wait—this might complicate things because for empty trees or nodes without attributes.

So to handle this:

In each step:
- Check that both u and v have 'attr' key; else → not isomorphic.
- Then compare their 'attr's
- Then check if they have the same number of children (each)
   - But how are the children represented? As a list or some iterable.

So during BFS:

queue1 starts with root nodes. If both trees have no root, return True; else False.

Each dequeued node must be checked to have 'attr' and its children as per structure.

Hence, in code, I need to make sure that each step enforces the same attributes and structures.

Thus, perhaps implementing:

def are_isomorphic(tree1, tree2):
    from collections import deque

    # Check if both trees have root nodes; else handle cases
    def get_children(node):
        return node.get('children', [])

    queue1 = deque()
    queue2 = deque()

    # Initialize with the first nodes (roots)
    try:
        u = tree1.get('root', None)  # Or perhaps, directly start with tree1
    except KeyError:
        if tree1 is not None and 'root' not in tree1:
            return False

Wait—actually, I think that trees are represented as dictionaries where each node (including root) has a key 'children'. So the initial step would be to check for their roots.

But perhaps the function should handle cases where a tree might have no root. For example, if one is None and the other isn't → return False.

Wait—let me think about this in code:

- If both are None → True (empty trees)
- Else if one is None but not the other → False
Else:
   Check their structures as per BFS

But wait, in our initial function above, we have to make sure that for each node u and v dequeued from queues, they have 'attr' key.

So perhaps code should:

Check that both trees are valid: if any is None but the other isn't → return False.
Else:
   Initialize queue1 with tree1's root (tree1 itself)
   Similarly for queue2
But how to get roots? Because in a dictionary, the first node could be arbitrary.

Wait—this may complicate. Alternatively, perhaps each tree must have one and only one root: represented as their top-level keys.

Assuming that each tree is such that it has exactly one node at the deepest level (the root), so that when we do BFS, starting with the root nodes, and checking children.

Alternatively, if a node exists but has no 'children' key → is it considered an empty subtree? Hmm—perhaps not. So perhaps during traversal:

Each dequeued node u must have 'attr' as well as 'children'.

But then again, what about empty trees (u or v doesn't exist; perhaps that's handled before).

Thus, in code:

def are_isomorphic(tree1, tree2):
    from collections import deque

    def get_children(node):
        return node.get('children', [])

    # Get root nodes
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) and not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return False  # Not dictionaries; can't be isomorphic trees
    try:
        u_root = next(iter(tree1.keys()))
    except StopIteration:  # tree1 is empty
        pass
    else:
        try:
            v_root = next(iter(tree2.keys()))
        except StopIteration:  # tree2 is empty if tree1 is not
            return False

    # Check both trees are either non-empty and have root
    if len(tree1) ==0 or len(tree2)==0:
        return True if (len(tree1)==0 and len(tree2)==0) else False

    queue1 = deque()
    queue2 = deque()

    u_root_node = tree1
    v_root_node = tree2

    # Check roots have 'attr' key
    if not ('attr' in u_root_node):
        return False
    if not ('attr' in v_root_node):
        return False

    if u_root_node['attr'] != v_root_node['attr']:
        return False

    queue1.append(u_root_node)
    queue2.append(v_root_node)

    while queue1 and queue2:
        u = queue1.popleft()
        v = queue2.popleft()

        # Check children
        num_children_u = len(get_children(u))
        num_children_v = len(get_children(v))

        if num_children_u != num_children_v:
            return False

        for child_u, child_v in zip(get_children(u), get_children(v)):
            queue1.append(child_u)
            queue2.append(child_v)

    # All nodes checked
    return True

Wait—wait. So this function:

- Checks that tree1 and tree2 are dictionaries (non-empty)
   Because if either is not a dict, or has no keys → returns False unless both are dicts with zero size.

But what about when the trees have multiple root nodes? For example, perhaps each tree may have more than one node at certain levels. But in that case, they can't be isomorphic because BFS would find different numbers of children.

Wait, perhaps not: for example:

Tree1 = {'a': [{'children': [ ... ]}, ...], but I think the structure needs to represent a single root node with possibly multiple attributes.

Alternatively, it's possible that tree nodes are structured as 'attr' being a key in each node, and all non-attr keys must be children (with their own attr).

But perhaps this is getting too complex. So, given that the initial code provided by the user uses get_children, which returns tree.get('children', []), I can write the function accordingly.

So here's an outline:

Function are_isomorphic(tree1, tree2):
    if either tree1 or tree2 is None:
        return (tree1 is None and tree2 is None)
    
    # Ensure both are dicts
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) or not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return False

    queue1 = deque()
    queue2 = deque()

    try:
        u = next(iter(tree1.keys()))
        v = next(iter(tree2.keys()))
    except StopIteration:
        # One is empty and the other isn't
        if (tree1 == {} and tree2 != {}):
            return False
        elif (tree2 == {} and tree1 != {}):
            return False
        else:  # both are empty
            return True

    queue1.append(u)
    queue2.append(v)

    while queue1 and queue2:
        u = queue1.popleft()
        v = queue2.popleft()

        if 'attr' not in u or 'attr' not in v:
            return False  # At least one is missing
        if u['attr'] != v['attr']:
            return False

        num_children_u = len(u.get('children', []))
        num_children_v = len(v.get('children', []))

        if num_children_u != num_children_v:
            return False

        for child_u, child_v in zip(u.get('children', []), v.get('children', [])):
            queue1.append(child_u)
            queue2.append(child_v)

    # All nodes checked
    return True

This should handle the cases where each node has an 'attr' and a list of children.

Testing this function with some examples:

Example 1:
tree1 = {'attr': 1, 'children': [{'attr':2}, {'attr':3}]}
tree2 = {'attr':1, 'children': [{'attr':2}, {'attr':3}]}
are_isomorphic(tree1, tree2) → True

Example 2:
tree1 = {'attr':1, 'children': [{'attr':2}, {'attr':4}]}
tree2 = {'attr':1, 'children': [{'attr':2}]}
→ False

Example3:
tree1 is empty and tree2 is empty → return True
if one is empty and the other not: return False.

Another case where nodes have different children:

tree1 = {'a': [{'children': [ ]}, {'children': [ ]}], 'attr': 0} # Wait, no. Each node must be a dictionary with 'attr' key, right? So perhaps tree nodes are such that each is processed as a node.

Wait wait: in this code, when we extract u from the queue, it's considered to be a node which has an 'attr' and children (children being other nodes). So for example:

tree1 = {'a': [{'attr':2}, {'attr':3}], ...} → but that would have multiple root nodes.

Wait, perhaps this code won't handle cases where a tree has more than one root at higher levels. Because in the BFS approach, when you process each node and enqueue their children, it's expecting all nodes to be processed level by level.

But for example:

tree1 = {'a': [{'attr':2}], 'b': [{'attr':3}]}
tree2 is the same structure.
In this case, tree1 has two root nodes: 'a' and 'b', each leading to their own child. So in BFS processing, when you dequeue u (which could be either 'a' or 'b'), process its children, then proceed.

But during the first iteration:

queue contains {'a'} and {'b'}

Dequeue 'a': check 'attr' is 2; then it has one child, which is { ... } with attr 3. Enqueue that.
Then dequeue 'b': 'attr' is 3 → but in tree2, this must match.

Wait, no: if tree1 and tree2 are same structure, then for each node in BFS, the attributes must be equal, right? So this code should handle such cases because it processes all root nodes (if any) before their children. But wait:

What's the initial step?

Suppose both trees have multiple root nodes.

In that case, during the first iteration of the while loop, each node is processed in turn.

But for a tree to be isomorphic to another tree with same structure but different attributes, this function would correctly return False if any 'attr' differs. However, it's possible for two such trees with multiple root nodes to have all roots matching and their children also matching.

So perhaps the code works as intended.

Another test case:

tree1 = {'root': [{'children': [{'attr': 2}]}, ...]} → Not sure; maybe this is overcomplicating. Let me pick a concrete example.

Wait, for tree1 and tree2 to be considered isomorphic, each node in BFS must match the 'attr' of corresponding nodes at same level. So yes, regardless of how many root nodes are present (all roots must have same 'attr'), then their children's structures must also match recursively.

Thus, the code should handle cases with multiple root nodes as long as all their attributes match and their subtrees correspond correctly.

Another possible issue is when a node has more or fewer children than expected. For example:

tree1: {'a': [{'children': []}, {'attr': 2}]}

tree2: {'b': [{'attr': 3}]} 

In this case, tree1's root 'a' must have two children with attribute values, but in BFS after processing u='a', the function expects exactly as many children. So it should return False because num_children_u is 2, while for 'b' it would be 1.

Thus, the code correctly returns False.

So overall, this approach seems solid.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine if two given trees are isomorphic. Two trees are isomorphic if they have the same structure and corresponding nodes at each level have the same attributes. 

### Approach
The solution involves using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal algorithm to compare the structure of the two trees node by node. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Check for None Values**: If either of the input trees is `None`, they can only be considered isomorphic if both are `None`.
2. **Check for Dictionary Type**: Ensure both inputs are dictionaries, as non-dictionary types cannot represent tree structures.
3. **Extract Root Nodes**: Identify the root nodes of each tree. If one tree has no roots and the other does, they are not isomorphic.
4. **BFS Traversal**: Use a queue to process each node level by level:
   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
   - Check if its attribute matches the corresponding node in the other tree.
   - Enqueue all children nodes for further processing.
5. **Match Children Structures**: Ensure that each node has the same number and structure of child nodes as their counterparts in the other tree.

This approach ensures that both trees are processed level by level, checking both the attributes of nodes and their structural consistency.

### Solution Code

```python
from collections import deque

def is_isomorphic(tree1, tree2):
    if tree1 is None:
        return tree2 is None
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) or not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return False
    # Extract root nodes from each tree. A tree may have multiple roots.
    roots1 = [k for k in tree1.keys()]
    roots2 = [k for k in tree2.keys()]
    
    if len(roots1) != len(roots2):
        return False
    
    queue = deque()
    # Enqueue all root nodes from both trees
    for root in roots1:
        queue.append((root, None))  # The second element is a dummy value to handle children processing
    
    while queue:
        current_node, expected_attribute = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_node in tree1 and expected_attribute == tree2[current_node]:
            if current_node not in tree1 or (not isinstance(tree1[current_node], dict)):
                continue
            # Now check for the children attributes
            children1 = list(tree1[current_node].values())
            children2 = list(tree2[expected_attribute].values())
            
            if len(children1) != len(children2):
                return False
            
            # Enqueue all child nodes, pairing them with their expected attribute in tree2
            for i in range(len(children1)):
                queue.append((children1[i], children2[i]))
        else:
            # The current node's attribute doesn't match the expected one
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Checks**: Ensure both inputs are valid and handle cases where either tree is `None`.
- **Root Extraction**: Identify all root nodes in each tree. If the number of roots differs, the trees are not isomorphic.
- **BFS Traversal**: Process each node level by level, ensuring that corresponding nodes have matching attributes and their children structures align correctly.
- **Child Processing**: For each node processed, check its children against the expected children from the other tree, maintaining consistency in structure.

This method efficiently checks for isomorphism by leveraging BFS to explore both trees simultaneously, ensuring structural and attribute consistency at every level.
