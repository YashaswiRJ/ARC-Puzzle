User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here that involves some kind of tree structure. It looks like there's an input and an expected output, which is a tree with certain properties defined at each node. The input starts with something like (0 (0, 0) (12x12) 0 [[0, 0, ..., 0]]) and then goes on with more elements.

First off, I need to understand what this notation represents. It seems like it's a tree where each node has some attributes: the first number is probably the index or something, followed by parameters in parentheses, and then an array of children nodes. The numbers inside the arrays are either 0s, 1s, or other structures.

Looking at the sample input and output might help clarify things. In the test example, the input starts with (0 (0,0) ...). Then it goes into sub-nodes like (4x4), which I assume is a matrix size of 4x4. The numbers in parentheses after each node seem to represent dimensions or other parameters.

The output tree structure includes elements like (0 (0,0) ...) and then more detailed nodes with different values inside the arrays, such as [[1]], [[2]], etc. There's also mention of matrices being multiplied by certain factors at various levels.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly to interpret these numbers and how they relate to each other in terms of building the tree structure correctly. Maybe I should start by breaking down the input into smaller parts and see if there's a pattern or rule that transforms one part into another.

For example, looking at the first few elements:

- The main node starts with 0 (0, 0) followed by (12x12), then 0 [[0,...]].
- Then it has sub-nodes like 4 (1,6), which might correspond to a 4x4 matrix located at position 1 in some dimension.

Perhaps each number represents the size of a block or layer in the tree. The notation like [3x5] could mean that this node is part of a 3-dimensional structure with dimensions 3 and 5? Or maybe it's representing something else, like a tensor shape?

Another thing I notice is that there are elements labeled as (12x12), which might indicate the size of a matrix or array associated with that node. The numbers inside the brackets after each sub-node seem to be indices or positions within these structures.

I'm also trying to understand how matrices are being multiplied or combined at different levels. For instance, there's an element labeled 4 (1,6) followed by [[1]]. Maybe this means taking a part of the matrix and applying some operation that results in another value.

Wait, I think each node might have multiple children, represented by the numbers inside the array brackets. So for example, after 0 (0,0), there's a sub-node with parameters (4x4) and then [[0,...]]. This could mean that this node has four child nodes, each corresponding to a row or column in the matrix.

But I'm not entirely sure how to map these numbers correctly. Maybe it would help to see if there are any patterns in the indices or if certain positions consistently correspond to specific operations or values.

I should also consider whether there's an iterative process involved, where smaller structures are built up from smaller matrices and then combined into larger ones according to some rules. This might involve matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, or transpositions.

Let me try sketching out the structure with a simpler example. Suppose I have (0 (1,2) ...). Maybe this represents a node that has two children, each corresponding to elements at positions 1 and 2 in some array.

But without knowing exactly what these numbers represent—whether they're indices into an array, matrix sizes, or something else—I might be going down the wrong path. Perhaps I need to reference any documentation or previous examples related to this notation to get a better understanding of each component's meaning.

Alternatively, maybe treating each number as a dimension in a higher-dimensional space could help. For example, 4x4 would mean two dimensions, each of size 4. Then, within that structure, other numbers like (1,6) could represent coordinates or indices along those dimensions.

I'm also noticing repeated elements like [[1]] and [[2]], which might indicate some sort of uniform value assignment to multiple positions at once. This suggests that certain operations can be applied in bulk rather than individually to each element.

Another approach could be to think about the tree as a graph where nodes are connected based on their numbers, forming paths from the root node (0) down to the leaves. Each branch might represent a choice or an operation, and following these branches would help build out the full structure step by step.

But honestly, without more context or examples, it's challenging to pin down exactly what each number represents. I think I need to focus on one part at a time and try to deduce its meaning based on how it relates to its parent node and any children it might have.

Maybe looking at the output tree will give me some clues about the expected structure once everything is built out. The sample output shows multiple levels with varying numbers inside arrays, suggesting that higher-level nodes combine or aggregate information from their children in specific ways.

In summary, I realize that interpreting this notation accurately requires understanding each component's role and how they interact within the tree hierarchy. Without more detailed information or examples, it might be challenging to construct the tree correctly every time, but approaching it step by step and focusing on individual parts could make the process manageable.

To solve the problem of constructing a tree based on the given input notation, we need to carefully analyze each component and its significance in building the tree structure. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Understanding the Input Structure:**
   - The input begins with a main node represented by `0 (0, 0)`, followed by a matrix size `(12x12)`.
   - This indicates that the main node has child nodes associated with a 12x12 matrix.

2. **Breaking Down Sub-Nodes:**
   - Each subsequent number in parentheses represents a sub-node or a specific section within the tree.
   - For example, `4 (1,6)` suggests a sub-node located at position `(1,6)` within a 4x4 matrix.

3. **Interpreting Arrays and Values:**
   - Arrays like `[0, 0, ..., 0]` likely represent values assigned to different positions in the matrix.
   - Elements such as `[[1]]` might denote specific operations or uniform assignments to certain sections of the tree.

4. **Constructing the Tree:**
   - Begin with the main node and its children based on the matrix size `(12x12)`.
   - For each sub-node, determine its position within its respective matrix using coordinates like `(1,6)`.
   - Assign values or perform operations as indicated by elements in arrays.

5. **Handling Matrix Operations:**
   - Recognize that certain numbers (like `4` and `3`) might represent dimensions or layers within the tree.
   - Apply appropriate operations based on these dimensions, such as matrix multiplication or element-wise assignments.

6. **Ensuring Consistency Across Levels:**
   - Verify that each level of the tree maintains consistency in its structure and values.
   - Check for patterns or repetitions (e.g., repeated `[[1]]` elements) to ensure correct bulk operations.

By methodically analyzing each component and following the hierarchical structure, we can construct the desired tree accurately. This approach ensures that each node's role and interactions are correctly interpreted at every level of the tree.
