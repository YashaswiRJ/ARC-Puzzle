User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. Let's take a deep breath and break it down step by step.

First off, the user provided some kind of tree structure with numbers and brackets in both the train example and the test example. The task seems to be about transforming one tree into another based on certain rules or patterns. My goal is probably to figure out what those transformations are and then apply them to the test example to get the correct output.

Looking at the train example, it starts with an input tree and ends with an output tree. I need to see how they're related. Let me write down both trees clearly:

**Input Tree (Train Example 1):**
```
(0 
   (0, 0) 
   (7x8) 0 [[0,0,...], ..., [0,0,...]] 
    (7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1],[1],..., [1]]) )
```

**Output Tree:**
```
(0 
   (0, 0) 
   (7x8) 0 [[0,...], ..., [0,...]] 
    (7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] ) ... etc.
```

Hmm, I notice that the main structure—like the numbers and the brackets inside—are similar. The key differences are in some of the inner lists where there's an increase from 0 to something else.

Wait, let me see if I can spot a pattern here. For instance, in the input tree under (7x8), there's a part with [1], but in the output, that becomes [[1]]. Is it about wrapping another list around? Or maybe replacing zeros with numbers?

Looking at specific points:

In the train example, one of the branches is:
```
(0 (0, 2) (3x1) 5 [[1], [1], [1]])
```
And in the output, this becomes something like:
```
(7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] )
```

Wait, no. Actually, looking back:

The input tree has a part under (7x8):
- (7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1], [1], ..., [1]]) where there are five lists of ones.
In the output, this changes to:
- (7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] ) which is a single list with one element.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe it's about how many times certain elements repeat or something else.

Let me think differently. Perhaps each number in parentheses represents some kind of count or index, and the lists within represent substructures or data associated with them. 

Another angle: maybe the numbers before the brackets are counts for something, like how many children a node has? So (7x8) might mean 7 nodes, each having 8 children.

Looking at the test example:

**Input Tree (Test Example):**
```
(0 
   (0, 0) 
   (9x9) 0 [[0,...], ..., [0,...]] 
    (7 (0,5) (7x1) 1 [[1],[..., ...], ..., [1]]) )
```

I need to transform this into an output tree similar to the train example but adjusted for these numbers.

Wait a minute. In both examples, under certain nodes, there are lists like [1], and sometimes they're expanded or changed in some way. Maybe each 0 is replaced with a count of something else?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how the numbers inside the inner brackets change based on their position. For instance, when a node has more children, its associated list grows.

Let me compare specific parts:

In the train example's input:
- (7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1], [1], ..., [1]]) 
This seems to have five sublists each containing one '1'.

But in the output, this becomes something like 7 having a single sublist with seven ones? Wait no. Looking at the output tree for train example:

The part under (5x1) is:
(7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] )

Wait, that's not matching directly. Maybe I need to track each number and its corresponding transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of replacing zeros with numbers based on their position in the tree.

Another thought: maybe this is about converting a certain type of tree into an array representation where counts and indices are adjusted accordingly.

Wait, let me think in terms of data structures. Suppose that each node has children represented by the numbers inside brackets. For example:

A node (a (b,c) (d x e) f [g1,g2,...]) might mean a parent with 'e' children, each indexed or something else.

Alternatively, it's similar to how certain tree traversals are represented in lists, and converting between them.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to consider the numbers outside the innermost brackets as counts for sublists.

Wait, let me look again:

In the train example input:
(7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1], [1], ..., [1]]) → So under node 7, child index 2 has a subtree with 5 nodes each having 1 child. The list here is five sublists of size one.

In the output, this becomes:
(7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] )

So now, instead of five sublists of [1], it's seven instances of a single sublist containing one '1'.

Wait, perhaps when moving from input to output, each element in these lists is increased by the number of children or something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: consider that each list inside represents the number of nodes and their connections.

Alternatively, maybe it's about adding up counts based on certain conditions. For example, replacing a zero with one more than its position.

Wait, perhaps in the input tree, when you have 0 as an index, in the output it becomes something else.

In the train example:

Original:
(7 (0,2) ... 1 [[...]]) 

Output:
(7 (0,6)... 7 [[1]] )

So from 0 becoming 6? Where did that come from?

Hmm. Maybe each position is being mapped based on some calculation involving its parent node's count.

But I'm not seeing it clearly. Maybe another strategy: let's see how the numbers change step by step in each part of the tree.

Looking at the input and output trees:

For the train example, under (7x8), there are multiple branches. Let me pick one to focus on:

Input:
(0 
   (0, 2) 
   (3x1) 5 [[1], [1], ..., [1]] )

Output becomes something like:
(0
   (0,6)
   (1x1)7[[1]]
)

Wait, no. Let me check the actual structure:

In the input tree's output version, this part changes from 5 to 7? Or is it that the sublist inside becomes [[1]]?

I think I'm getting too confused without a clear pattern.

Maybe another approach: suppose each number outside the innermost brackets represents how many times that index appears in the next level. So for example:

- In (0,2), which might be an index 2 with 0 count, it becomes (0,6) meaning same index but different count?

Wait, perhaps each time a node has children, its index is being adjusted by some function.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of times a certain subtree appears under a node. For example, if a node had two children, then in the output tree, those children are represented differently.

But I'm not getting anywhere concrete here. Maybe I should consider that this transformation involves replacing each '0' with an increasing number based on some depth or position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about converting the entire structure into an array where each node's count is incremented by a certain value depending on its position.

Wait, looking at another part:

In the train example input:
(7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1],..., [1]]) 

Output becomes:
(7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] )

So here, under node 7, which had an index 2 with a count of 5 and list size 1, it now has index 6 with count 1 and list size 7.

Hmm. So the initial index was 2 → became 6? The count went from 5 to 1. The sublist length changed from 1 to 7.

Wait, perhaps each element in those lists is being treated as a multiplier for something else. Or maybe it's about transposing rows and columns if we think of these as matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps the index numbers are being shifted by multiplying or adding some value based on their position.

Another idea: let's look at how many nodes there are in each subtree to see if that gives any clues.

In the train example input:

- The main structure is (7x8) which I'm guessing means 7 nodes with 8 children each, totaling 56 nodes.
- One of its subtrees is (5x1), meaning 5 nodes each with 1 child → total 5 nodes. So that's straightforward.

In the output, this becomes:

- Under node 7: (0,6) which might mean an index 6 but count 0? Or perhaps it's a different structure.
Wait no, in the output tree for the train example, under the main (7x8), there's a (1x1) subtree.

So maybe each (count x size) is being transformed into something else. For example:

- The original (5x1): 5 nodes with 1 child → becomes (1x1): 1 node with 1 child.
That suggests that the count and size are swapped or something like that.

If I look at other parts, does this pattern hold?

In another part of the input tree:
(0) under some parent. In output, it's (6). So maybe adding to the index?

Alternatively, perhaps each node's index is being adjusted based on its position in the array.

But without more data points, it's hard to see.

Maybe I need to consider that this transformation is similar to a matrix transpose or reshaping. If we have a list of lists and we want to reshape them into different dimensions.

For example:

- Original subtree: [[1], [1], ..., [1]] → 5 elements each with one sublist.
If we transpose it, perhaps each row becomes columns, but I'm not sure how that maps here.

Alternatively, considering the entire structure as a tree and transforming its node counts based on some rule.

But honestly, I'm stuck. Maybe the transformation involves incrementing all indices by a certain number or reversing their order.

Wait, in one case, 0 became 6. If there were other nodes with similar transformations, maybe it's adding a fixed value to each index. For example, if you add 6 everywhere? But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is more about the layout of how the tree is represented rather than changing the numbers themselves.

Wait, maybe the key is in the differences between input and output:

In the train example, under (7x8), one subtree was (5x1) → now it's (1x1). Another part had 0 count at index 2 becoming something else.

Perhaps each node with a certain number of children is being split into multiple nodes in some way. For instance, if a node has k children, then in the output tree, those are represented as individual nodes under that parent.

But again, without knowing exactly how this transformation works, it's hard to say.

Maybe I should consider looking for patterns where numbers change from higher to lower or vice versa. Like 5x1 becomes 1x1—so perhaps counts are being inverted in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the index is being treated as a pointer into an array of counts, and each count represents how many times that index appears in the next level.

Wait, if you think about it like this: node (7)(0,2) has 5 children. So perhaps the number 5 comes from some function involving its parent's index and other parameters.

But again, without more examples, it's difficult to determine the exact rule.

Maybe I should give up and consider that each 'x' in x y represents a count of nodes with parameter y. Then, transforming them into another structure where counts are adjusted based on some operation like addition or multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about linked lists being transformed into arrays, but again, not sure.

Wait, going back to the specific example:

Input tree:
(7 (0,2) (5x1) 1 [[1], [1], ..., [1]])

Output becomes:
(7 (0,6) (1x1) 7 [[1]] )

So from under node 7: index was 2 and count was 5. Now it's index 6 with count 1.

Another part had a sublist of size 1 becoming size 7. So maybe the indices are being mapped based on some relationship, perhaps adding up in another way.

Wait, if you take each element from before, like [0][2] and get to [0][6], perhaps 2 + something equals 6? Maybe 4?

Alternatively, considering that node counts might be adjusted by a fixed number. Like maybe the index is being shifted by adding a certain value based on its position in the tree.

But without more data points, it's hard to find the exact pattern.

Perhaps another approach: count how many nodes are at each level before and after transformation to see if there's consistency.

In the input subtree (5x1), which has 5 nodes. In output, under node 7, there's a (1x1) subtree with 1 node. Then elsewhere, maybe similar reductions?

But that would mean fewer nodes overall, but I'm not sure how it affects each part.

Wait, perhaps the transformation involves merging multiple children into one or something else.

In another thought, if you look at the entire input and output trees:

Input has several subtrees with (count x size) structures. The output replaces these in some way, possibly converting counts to sizes and vice versa.

For example, subtree (5x1) becomes (1x1), so 5 → 1 as count, but remains same as size.

Similarly, if another subtree was (0) becoming something else, perhaps that's a base case where no children are present.

But honestly, without more information or examples, I can't conclusively determine the transformation rule. It might be based on specific tree traversal algorithms like BFS vs DFS, but again, not sure.

Maybe it's best to assume that each 'x' in (count x size) is being converted such that count becomes 1 and size remains same? Like converting a node with multiple children into one child?

But then the first subtree was transformed from (5x1) → (1x1), so maybe that makes sense. Similarly, perhaps other nodes are undergoing similar transformations.

Alternatively, if we think of each 'count x size' as an array where count is how many elements in the array and size determines something about each element's structure.

So for example, 5x1 would be an array with 5 elements, each of size 1. Then transforming it into (1x1) could mean that all those 5 arrays are being combined or restructured.

But again, without knowing how the overall tree is transformed beyond this subtree, it's hard to say.

Perhaps another angle: think about flattening the tree in a certain way where each node's children become individual nodes at the next level. But I'm not sure if that aligns with the given transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the indices are being adjusted based on their position in some order traversal.

Wait, considering that in one part of the output, 0 became 6: perhaps the index is determined by a breadth-first search or another traversal method where each node's children are assigned new indices incrementally.

But without knowing how exactly the tree was traversed and transformed, it's hard to say.

I think I've exhausted my approaches for now. Maybe someone with more knowledge of tree transformations could explain better.
</think>

The transformation appears to involve restructuring parts of the tree by changing both the counts and sizes of nodes' children based on certain rules. Specifically:

1. **Node Indices**: The indices under each node are being adjusted, possibly through a specific traversal or calculation method (e.g., breadth-first search order).
2. **Counts and Sizes**: Counts of children are transformed into sizes, often reducing multiple children to one in some cases.

For example:
- A node with 5 children at index 2 becomes a single child at index 6.
- A subtree previously represented as `[[1], [1], ..., [1]]` (size 5) is transformed into `[1]`, indicating that all children are condensed or restructured into a single element.

These transformations suggest the tree's structure is being reorganized to represent nodes in a different hierarchical format.
