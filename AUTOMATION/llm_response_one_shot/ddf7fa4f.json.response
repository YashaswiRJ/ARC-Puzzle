User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what's going on with these inputs and outputs. Let me start by trying to understand the structure of the input first.

Looking at the test example, it seems like there are multiple parts separated by parentheses. Each part has numbers and some kind of matrix or array attached. For instance, one part is (3 (0, 0) (1x1) 1 [[1]] ). Maybe this represents a node with certain parameters: a value, coordinates, dimensions, and an array.

So maybe each tuple corresponds to a node in a tree structure. The first number could be the index or identifier of the node. The next part is probably its position, like (x,y) coordinates. Then there's something about dimensions, like 10x10 here, which might indicate the size of some matrix or grid it's connected to.

After that, I see an array inside another set of brackets. These arrays are filled with zeros and ones. It looks a lot like matrices where each element is either 0 or 1. For example, [[0, 0, ...], [0, 0, ...], etc.] up to ten elements in each row.

Now, looking at the output for this test case: it's another set of similar tuples with different values and arrays. So maybe the process involves transforming these input matrices into some kind of structure based on their contents.

Wait, let me try to see if there's a pattern here. The first part has 10x10 matrix filled entirely with zeros except for one position where it might have ones? Or is it the other way around?

Looking at the test example, each node seems to be connected based on its coordinates and dimensions. Then the output arrays are different but seem related to these input matrices.

Perhaps each array in the input represents a connection or some kind of weight between nodes, and the output processes this into another structure. Maybe it's about finding connections where there are ones indicating edges between nodes.

Alternatively, maybe it's counting how many times certain patterns appear based on the zeros and ones.

Wait, looking at the numbers after each node: like 3 (0,0) (1x1) 1 [[1]] could mean that this node has a value of 3, is located at (0,0), its size is 1x1, and it's associated with an array containing just [1]. Maybe the number before the coordinates represents something else.

Alternatively, maybe each tuple after the initial one is describing some kind of transformation or operation applied to the previous structure. For example, in the test case, there are multiple such tuples that build upon each other.

Hmm, perhaps it's about creating a matrix where certain positions have ones and others don't, based on their coordinates relative to the node's position.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try breaking down one example step by step.

Take the first part of the test input:

(0 (0, 1) (1x1) 1 [[1]]) 

So index 0, at (0,1), size 1x1, value 1 with a matrix of [1]. Then another tuple:

(6 (0,5) (1x1) 2 [[1]])

Index 6, position (0,5), size 1x1, value 2.

Then another:

(7 (0,8) (1x1) 3 [[1]]) 

Index 7 at (0,8), same details.

Next part is a more complex structure:

(1 (2,1) (3x2) 4 [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]])

So index 1, position (2,1), size 3x2, value 4 with an array of three rows each having two ones.

Then another part:

(7 (3,7) (2x3) 5 [[1,1,1], [1,1,1]])

Index 7 at (3,7), size 2x3, value 5 and the matrix is two rows with three ones each.

Another one:

(6 (5,3) (3x3) 6 [[1,1,1], ...])

And so on. It seems like these are nodes that might be connected in a grid or some kind of graph structure based on their coordinates.

Now looking at the output for this test case, which is another set of similar tuples:

(3 (0,0) (1x1) 1 [[1]] )

(6 (0,4) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )

(9 (0,8) (1x1) 3 [[1]] )

Wait a minute, in the output, we have indices like 3, 6, 9. Is there a pattern here? They seem to be spaced by 3 each time.

In the input, those same positions were at (2,1), (3,7)... Hmm, maybe it's about grouping nodes or aggregating data based on their original indices?

Alternatively, perhaps the output is creating a new set of nodes where every third node from the input is selected. For example, in the test case, the input has 9 such tuples, and the output also has 3 tuples with indices 3,6,9.

That could mean that for each group of three nodes in the input, we're selecting one based on some criteria. Maybe it's selecting nodes where their index is divisible by 3 or something like that.

Wait, but let me check another part. In the test example, after these initial tuples, there are more complex ones with matrices and so on. So maybe the process involves taking all these input tuples, processing them based on certain rules to group or filter them into a new set of nodes in the output.

So perhaps each tuple in the input is being processed independently, but their positions or values determine how they're included in the output.

Looking at another part:

Input has (1 (2,1) 3x2 [ [1,1], ... ]) and output includes something like (7...). Maybe this is about adding up indices or coordinates to get new indices.

Alternatively, maybe each step involves some kind of matrix multiplication where the arrays are involved. For example, processing a node's array by multiplying it with another matrix.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me try to see if there's an operation that can transform these input matrices into ones in the output.

Wait, looking at one part:

Input: 1 (2,1) (3x2) [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]] with value 4.

Output has a tuple where index is 7. Maybe 4 multiplied by something gives 7? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about summing the ones in each row or column of the matrix to get some new value.

In this case, each row has two 1s, so three rows would give a total of six 1s. But how does that relate to index 7?

Hmm, perhaps not directly related by counting.

Wait, maybe it's about concatenating certain values or using their positions in the array.

Alternatively, perhaps these tuples are being transformed based on their coordinates relative to some origin point.

For example, (2,1) could be a position where we add up something like 2 + 1 = 3, which might relate to the index in the output. But I'm not sure how that would translate.

Alternatively, maybe each node's value is being used as an index into another structure based on their coordinates.

Wait, perhaps for each tuple in the input, we take its position (x,y) and use x + y or some function of it to get a new index in the output. For example:

In the first complex part:
- 1 at (2,1): 2+1=3
But the output is (7...), which doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe multiplying x by y: 2*1=2. But output's index is 7.

Hmm, that doesn't seem to add up either.

Wait another thought: perhaps each input tuple represents a node in a grid, and the output tuples are nodes selected from this grid based on certain criteria like every third node starting from some point or having specific properties related to their arrays.

Looking at the test case's input:

- There are 9 initial tuples, then more complex ones. The output has three main groups of tuples: (3...), (6...), and (9...). So perhaps these are nodes selected based on a step size from the original indices?

Wait, maybe each group in the output represents nodes collected every certain steps from their input positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about processing arrays into new ones. For example, if an array has all zeros except one position with a 1, that might indicate a connection or something else.

But given that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of the overall process as some kind of graph transformation where nodes are being processed and grouped based on their coordinates and matrix values into new structures. The output seems to have a similar form but fewer tuples, possibly indicating aggregation or selection of certain nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps each node in the input is transformed by counting the number of 1s in its array and then using that count as an index for another part of the structure.

In the first complex tuple: [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]] has six 1s. Maybe this relates to some value being set or something else.

But looking at the output's corresponding tuples, it seems like each input tuple is mapped directly with a new index and array in the output without considering their counts of 1s.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the overall process involves taking all these nodes into account and selecting a subset based on some criteria. For instance, only including nodes where their value (the numerical part) is divisible by 3 or something like that.

In the test case's input:
- The first nine tuples have values:1,4,... etc., but in output, we see indices 3,6,9... which suggests a step of three. So perhaps only including every third node from their initial position? Or selecting nodes where their index modulo some number equals zero.

But how does that relate to the input's numerical value?

Alternatively, maybe it's about taking certain parts of each tuple and combining them into new tuples in the output based on an algorithm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the transformation involves taking multiple input tuples and aggregating their properties (like adding up indices or something) into a single output tuple. But this would complicate since in the test case, it's just mapping one to one.

But given that in the first part of the input, we have nine nodes (3 complex ones plus 6 simple), and the output has three groups with higher indices, perhaps each group is formed by processing a subset of these.

Alternatively, maybe this is an encoding problem where the tuples are being encoded into new forms based on certain rules. For instance, if all elements in the array are zero except one which is 1, then it's considered as some kind of indicator.

But I'm not making much progress here.

Maybe another thought: since each input tuple corresponds to a node with position (x,y) and possibly an array indicating connections or states, perhaps we're constructing a new graph where nodes are selected based on these positions and their connectedness is determined by the arrays. Then, in the output, only certain nodes are kept based on specific criteria.

But without more details, it's hard to pin down the exact operation.

Alternatively, maybe this process involves matrix operations like transposing or multiplying matrices associated with each node, but given that I can't see a direct correspondence between input and output arrays, it might not be applicable.

Wait, perhaps looking at one example:

Input tuple: 4 (2,1) (3x2) [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]]
Output has index=7. Maybe 2+1+4? 7, which matches.

Similarly, another input tuple:5 (0,0)(something) output is same as above?

Wait, let's check:

In the test case's first complex part:
- Tuple with value 4 maps to output index 7.
But 4 + (2+1)=7. That could be a possibility.

Another example: suppose there's another tuple in input where index=5, position=(0,0). If we map it by adding x+y, that would give 0+0=0, so perhaps the new index is 5 + something? Wait, no, because output indexes are higher than inputs in this case.

Wait, maybe for each node, its new index is original index plus (x + y).

So:

For input tuple with value 4 at position (2,1):

new index = 4 + (2+1)=7. That matches the output's first complex group.

Similarly, if there was a node with value 5 at (0,0), new index would be 5+0=5, but in the test case's output, that might not appear since it's not part of the output tuples.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps all these operations are additive. So for each input tuple, you take its numerical value and add its (x + y) to get a new index in the output.

If that's the case:

For the first complex group:
- 4 at (2,1): 2+1=3; 4+3=7 → Output index is 7. So yes, matches.
Similarly, any other tuple with value v and position (x,y) would have new index = v + x + y.

But how does this apply to the rest?

Let's take another input tuple from test case:

Suppose there's a node with value=3 at (0,2). Then new index would be 3+0+2=5. But in output, I don't see such an entry.

Wait, but maybe it's more complicated than that because each group has multiple nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is for all input tuples to map into a single or specific set of indices based on this rule.

But given limited information, it's hard to confirm. Maybe this additive approach could be part of the solution.

So, if I assume that the output index is calculated as v + x + y where v is the numerical value in the tuple, and (x,y) are its coordinates.

Then for each input tuple:

new_index = original_value + x + y

But looking back at test case's first complex group:

- Input has value=4, position=(2,1)
→ 4+2+1=7 → matches output index 7.

Another example: Suppose there was an input with v=3 and (x,y)=(0,2):

new_index = 3 + 0 + 2 =5

But in the test case's output tuples:

The second group has value 6. Maybe that comes from another calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps this is just one way to map it, but without seeing more examples or knowing how other groups are handled, I can't be certain.

Another thought: perhaps each group of nodes (like the first nine) maps into a higher index based on some formula involving their properties. For instance:

Group 1:
- Each node in this group has value v and position (x,y)
→ new_index = v + x * y

For example, if v=4 at (2,1):
new_index=4 + 2*1=6? But output is index=7.

Wait no. So that may not fit.

Alternatively:

Perhaps it's a matter of adding the sum of all elements in the array to the original value and position:

But for [1,1] with sum=2:
v=4 → 4 + (sum) =6? But output is 7.

Nope.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to think that each input group maps into a certain set of nodes based on some rule. For example, the first three simple tuples map into one node in output, etc., but this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about counting the number of non-zero elements or something else in the array and adding that to original value.

But given limited data, I can't be certain.

Given all these uncertainties, maybe the best approach is to suggest a possible solution based on the additive formula:

new_index = v + x + y

Where:
- v is the numerical value from the tuple
- (x,y) are the coordinates in the position part of the tuple

So each input tuple's new index would be computed as such, and then grouped accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for each node, its output index is determined by a combination of its properties—such as multiplying some components or adding them. But without concrete evidence from more examples, it's hard to validate.

Given the lack of further information, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that new_index = v + x + y.
</think>

The transformation involves calculating a new index for each input tuple by summing its numerical value and the coordinates of its position:

For each input tuple (v, x, y):
1. Compute the new index as `new_index = v + x + y`.
2. Group these computed indices to form the output tuples.

**Answer:**
\boxed{\text{Each output index is calculated by adding the numerical value and coordinates of its position in the corresponding input tuple.}}
