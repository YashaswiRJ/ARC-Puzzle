User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, let me try to figure out what this problem is asking. It looks like a grid of numbers with some specific operations mentioned in parentheses after each line. Each line seems to have parameters followed by an operation and then another set of brackets.

Starting from the top: (1x1) 11 [[1]] )... Hmm, maybe it's about matrix dimensions or something? The first part is "1x1", so that could be a 1x1 matrix. Then there's 11 with double brackets around [1]. Maybe this represents some kind of transformation?

Looking at the next line: (4 (14, 14) (1x1) 13 [[1]] )... So here it's a 4x something? Not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps each section is defining how to create or modify certain elements based on these parameters. The numbers before the parentheses might represent the number of rows and columns in a matrix, followed by some indices.

I see "8x9" later on; that seems significant because it's a specific size which could be related to another part of the problem. Maybe I need to construct an 8x9 grid based on these instructions?

Also, there are numbers like 12 and 4 appearing multiple times with different structures in the brackets. Perhaps each bracketed set is directing how values should be filled into a matrix.

Maybe this is similar to creating a sparse matrix where most elements are zero except for specific ones defined by these operations? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe breaking it down step by step will help.

Looking at "4 (5, 1) (1x1) 5 [[1]]", that seems like another section with parameters leading to placing a 5 in some position. Perhaps each operation is writing or updating specific cells in the grid?

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try sketching it out on paper? Since I can't see an image, maybe visualizing the matrix as per these instructions will help.

Another thought: The numbers before parentheses might indicate how many elements are being defined or changed in each step. For example, "1 (4, 0)..." could mean a section with four columns and zero rows or something like that.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Maybe it's better to look for patterns in the numbers provided. Let me list out all the sections:

- 1x1: 11 [[1]]
- 4 (14,14): 13 [[1]]
- 8x9: 4 [[1,...]] 

And some other lines with different parameters.

I wonder if these are related to matrix factorization or transformations. The double brackets might indicate vector operations?

Alternatively, perhaps each number before the parentheses is an operation code, and the rest define the parameters for that operation. For example, "8 (4,9) (14x10) 4 [[1,...]]" could mean applying a type 8 operation with certain inputs to create a matrix of size 14x10.

But I'm not sure how these operations are defined. Maybe each line is part of an algorithm that builds up the final matrix by performing specific steps based on the parameters and then updating it with new values in the brackets.

Another angle: The numbers like 12, 5, etc., inside the double brackets could be indices or positions where certain transformations should be applied. For instance, [[1,1,...], [1,0,...]] might mean placing ones except for a zero at specific spots.

I'm still not clear on what exactly is being asked here. Maybe I need to consider that this is part of an encoding or data structure representation? Like using matrices with specific patterns to encode information.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the dimensions and positions in a multi-dimensional array where each parameter set defines how elements are accessed or updated.

Wait, maybe these lines represent layers in a neural network or some kind of graph. The numbers before parentheses could be nodes or edges with certain properties.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to count the number of sections and see if there's a pattern. There's 1x1, then another 4..., followed by 8... It seems like powers of 2? 1, 4 (which is 2^2), 8 (2^3). But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each operation represents a transformation on the matrix, with parameters controlling how it's transformed. Like scaling or rotating?

Wait, another thought: The numbers in double brackets could be specifying some kind of encoding where each element is either 0 or 1 based on certain conditions defined by the operations before them.

If I consider that, then maybe each line defines a new matrix or part of an existing one with specific rules for filling in the entries. For example, "[[1,1,..],[1,0,...]]" could be setting up which elements are 1 and which are 0 based on previous operations.

But without knowing the exact rules of these operations, it's challenging to reconstruct the matrix step by step. Maybe each operation is a rule for updating or reading from a specific part of the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about binary matrices where certain positions are set to 1 and others remain 0 based on some criteria.

I think I need more context or clearer instructions. But since that's not available, maybe focusing on the numbers themselves could give me something useful.

Looking at "8x9": an 8-row by 9-column matrix is being defined with some operations in between. The final part inside the double brackets has a long list of ones and zeros: [1,0,...], which suggests it's a binary vector or row in that matrix.

Perhaps each section after ( ) defines how to create a specific row or column based on certain criteria like even indices being 1, odd being 0 or something like that.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is needed here. Since the user hasn't provided an image but has these lines of numbers and operations, maybe this is related to a specific algorithm or problem type, such as matrix decomposition, encoding schemes, or perhaps even graph theory.

Wait, considering all the parameters: size like 1x1, 4..., 8... Could they represent dimensions in layers? Like in a neural network with multiple hidden layers where each operation defines how data flows through them?

Alternatively, maybe it's about tensors rather than matrices, given the multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors can have more than two dimensions, so an 8x9x... something structure.

But again, without knowing what these operations are meant to achieve or represent, I'm just guessing.

Maybe focusing on the fact that all sections end with some kind of matrix definition (14x10, 5..., etc.) and they all have parameters before them. Perhaps each operation is a step in building up this final matrix by transforming parts of it based on previous steps.

But without knowing how these operations work, I'm stuck trying to figure out the exact process.

Another thought: The numbers inside the double brackets might be row indices or column positions where certain transformations are applied. For example, setting specific elements to 1 and others to 0 based on some rules defined by the parameters before each line.

Alternatively, maybe these lines represent different parts of a larger system, like nodes in a graph with connections defined by the numbers.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe all I need to do is recognize that this is about matrix operations and constructing or transforming matrices based on given rules.

In conclusion, without more information about what each operation represents, it's difficult to provide a precise answer. But if these are instructions for creating specific sections of a matrix with certain patterns or values in defined positions, the user might need to follow these steps sequentially to build up the final matrix.

It seems like you've presented a series of numbered lines with parameters and operations that could be related to constructing or transforming matrices based on specific rules. However, without additional context or clear instructions about what each operation represents, it's challenging to provide a precise answer.

If these lines are part of an algorithm or encoding scheme for creating matrices with specific patterns or values in defined positions, the user might need to follow these steps sequentially to build up the final matrix. For example, operations like setting certain elements to 1 and others to 0 based on conditions defined by previous parameters could be involved.

To proceed effectively, more clarity on the nature of these operations would be helpful. If you can provide additional details or clarify what each operation is meant to achieve, I might be able to assist further in reconstructing or understanding the matrix construction process.
