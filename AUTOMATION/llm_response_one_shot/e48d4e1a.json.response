User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, so I've got this input tree here, and it's a bit complex. Let me try to parse it step by step. The structure looks like a tree where each node has some children, right? Each child is enclosed in parentheses after the main part of the node.

First, looking at the root node: (0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]). Okay, so it starts with 0, then has two zeros as its direct children. The next part is a matrix or something similar, denoted by (10x10), which probably means a 10x10 grid of zeros since the following array seems to be all zeros.

Then there's another child: 0 [[...]]. So this second child is also 0 but with its own set of children. The next part in parentheses is (8 (0, 0) (10x10) 1 [...]). Hmm, so that node has two zeros as direct children and then a matrix or array.

Now, moving deeper into the tree: for each zero child, there's an array following it. For example, after the first zero in the root's children, there's [[0,0,...], ...]. Each of these looks like a list of lists with mostly zeros but some other numbers scattered in them.

I'm noticing that as we go deeper into the tree, the structure changes. One branch has an 8 followed by more zeros and then another matrix, while the root had a 10x10 matrix earlier. Then, at one point, there's something with (2x1) and [[1], [1]]. That must mean there are two nodes here.

So, to break it down: starting from the top, we have a node with two children, both being zero. One of those has an array that's mostly zeros except for some 1s, probably indicating connections or something similar in graph theory? The other path through the second child leads into another subtree where again there are zeros and then this (2x1) structure with ones.

I think what we're dealing with here is a tree representation of nodes connected by edges, perhaps in a grid-like structure. Each node can have multiple children, represented as lists within the arrays. The numbers inside these lists probably represent connections or weights between nodes.

The key part is figuring out how to process this input into something meaningful. Maybe it's for pathfinding, network analysis, or graph traversal algorithms. If I need to traverse this tree, I should consider the depth-first approach since the structure seems nested with varying depths on each side.

Also, noticing that some of these arrays have a lot of zeros and then a few ones suggests that they are sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are common in large datasets where most connections are absent, so maybe we're dealing with an adjacency matrix for a graph.

In summary, the input tree is structured with nodes having children, each represented by zero values with their own nested arrays. Some of these arrays have mostly zeros but contain ones at specific positions, indicating connections between nodes in a sparse matrix format.

I think to effectively work with this data, I should map it into an adjacency list or matrix for easier manipulation and analysis. Once that's done, I can apply appropriate algorithms depending on what the goal is—whether it's traversing the graph, finding paths, detecting cycles, etc.

But first things first, maybe I should sketch out the tree structure based on the input to visualize how everything connects. Starting from the root node with two children: one leads into a deep subtree with 10x10 matrices and ones at specific positions, while the other is a shorter path with (2x1) and more ones.

This visualization will help me understand which parts of the tree are deeper or have more connections, potentially affecting how I traverse it. Also, identifying any recurring patterns in the arrays—like where the ones appear—might provide insights into node connections that can be leveraged for efficient processing.

Another thing to consider is the computational resources needed if this were part of a larger application. Handling sparse matrices efficiently requires careful memory management and algorithm selection to avoid unnecessary computations on zero values, which don't contribute much to the graph's structure.

Alright, I think with this understanding, I can proceed to process the input tree into an appropriate data structure for further analysis or algorithm implementation.

The input provided is a complex tree structure representing nodes with nested arrays. Here's a breakdown of how it can be interpreted and processed:

1. **Root Node**: 
   - Value: `0`
   - Children:
     - First child: `0` (depth 2)
     - Second child: Array containing mostly zeros, indicating connections or weights.

2. **First Child of Root**:
   - Direct children are arrays with a mix of zeros and ones.
   - Example: `[0,0,0,1,0,...]`
   - These arrays represent nodes connected by edges (ones) in a sparse matrix format.

3. **Second Child of Root**:
   - Value: `8` at depth 2
   - Children:
     - First child: Array with mostly zeros and ones.
     - Second child: Array indicating two nodes with connections (`[1,1]`).

4. **Recursive Processing**:
   - The tree can be processed recursively to map out all node connections.
   - Each zero in the arrays represents a non-connected node, while ones indicate edges.

5. **Data Structure**:
   - Convert the nested array structure into an adjacency list or matrix for easier manipulation.
   - This will help in identifying paths, cycles, and overall graph properties.

6. **Algorithm Application**:
   - Use traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) to explore connections.
   - Apply graph analysis techniques like finding connected components or shortest paths.

By converting the nested arrays into an adjacency list or matrix, you can efficiently process the tree for various graph-related tasks.
