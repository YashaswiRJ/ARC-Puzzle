User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Alright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user provided this big block of numbers and some kind of nested parentheses structure with comments like (3 (x y) ...). Hmm, it looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First off, there are these numbers: 0, 14x16, followed by another set that's all zeros. Then there are several blocks each starting with 3 and some other numbers. Each of these blocks has something in parentheses, like (x y), which probably indicates positions or coordinates? And then a matrix inside the brackets.

Okay, let me try to parse this step by step. Starting from the top:

1. The first part is (0, 0) followed by (14x16). I'm guessing that represents a coordinate system where the origin is at (0,0), and each unit goes up to 14 in one direction and 16 in another? Maybe it's like a grid?

2. Then there are several lists of zeros. The first nine zeros seem to be arrays or rows with sixteen elements each because of the 16 mentioned earlier. So maybe this is a matrix that's partially filled?

3. Next, there are these blocks starting with (3 (x y) ...). Each block has a number like 3, followed by coordinates in parentheses, then another number, and a matrix inside square brackets.

For example, the first such block is:
- (3 (0,1) (3x3) 1 [[1,0,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]])
This seems like it's creating a 3x3 matrix at position (0,1), with all elements being ones except the middle element which is zero.

Similarly, another block:
- (3 (10,11) (3x3) 5 [[1,0,0],[1,0,0],[1,1,1]])
This would be a similar structure but at position (10,11) with the top-left element as 5 and others.

Wait, so are these blocks modifying specific parts of a larger matrix? Maybe they're setting certain regions based on coordinates?

Then another block:
- (3 (6,9) (3x4) 4 [[0,1,1,1],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]])
Here, it's a 3x4 matrix at position (6,9). The numbers inside the matrix are either zeros or ones. Maybe this is part of a larger grid where these smaller matrices are placed?

Continuing, each block seems to specify where and how much data they're contributing to a grid.

I'm also noticing that some blocks have different dimensions: 3x3, 3x4, etc., which suggests varying sizes for the submatrices. The numbers at the beginning like 1, 5, 4, etc., could be values assigned to each element in these matrices.

So perhaps this user is trying to construct a larger matrix by piecing together smaller matrices at specific coordinates? Maybe it's related to image processing or some kind of grid-based simulation?

But wait, I'm not sure. The structure seems more like a list of specifications rather than something executable directly. So the user might be asking how to interpret these components or maybe how they fit together into a larger matrix.

If that's the case, then my job is to figure out if there's a pattern in how these blocks are placed and what their values represent. Maybe each block is non-overlapping and contributes specific parts of the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps this is an attempt to create some kind of 2D grid where certain regions have predefined values based on these blocks.

Also, noticing that some submatrices have repeating patterns or use zeros as backgrounds with ones forming structures might indicate something about connectivity or shapes within a grid.

But without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is trying to visualize this data as a grid and needs help plotting it or understanding how these blocks fit together.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in interpreting the structure because of the formatting—maybe some elements are missing or misaligned? Let me check:

Looking at the last block:
- (3 (11, 1) (3x6) 6 [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,1]])
This is a 3x6 matrix at position (11,1). So, again, it's another section of the grid.

Putting all this together, I think the user has created several submatrices with specific values and placed them at certain coordinates within a larger grid. They might need help reconstructing that grid or understanding how to compute some property based on these entries.

Alternatively, maybe they're trying to solve for something—like determining overlaps between these blocks or calculating sums of specific regions?

I should probably ask the user for clarification if possible, but since I'm just responding here, maybe I can provide an analysis assuming different possibilities. For example, reconstructing a grid based on given submatrices.

So, in summary, it seems like they have multiple 3x3, 3x4, etc., matrices at specific (x,y) positions within a larger grid, and each matrix has values of either 0 or 1 with some other numbers. The user might be interested in visualizing this grid or performing calculations on it.

I should make sure to explain the structure clearly if they need help reconstructing it or analyzing it further.

It seems like you've provided a structured list of specifications for creating parts of a larger matrix, possibly for visualization or analysis. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The grid starts at origin (0,0) and extends to 14 in one direction and 16 in another.

2. **Blocks**:
   - Each block specifies coordinates (x,y), dimensions (like 3x3 or 3x4 matrices), a value, and the matrix itself.
   - For example, `(3 (0,1) (3x3) 1 [[1,0,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]])` creates a 3x3 matrix at position (0,1) with ones except for some zeros.

These blocks contribute to constructing specific parts of a larger grid. If you need help visualizing or analyzing this structure, feel free to ask!
