User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here that involves some kind of matrix or array with a bunch of numbers and symbols. Let me try to parse through it step by step because honestly, at first glance, it looks pretty intimidating. 

First off, the initial part is [0, 1, 1, ..., 1], and there are several of these arrays listed. It seems like each array has mostly ones except for a single zero somewhere in different positions. Maybe this is some kind of pattern or matrix structure? I'm not entirely sure, but let me note that down.

Then there's a line with (1 (6, 3) (1x1) 3 [[1]] ). Hmm, the numbers here might be indices or something related to where the zero is. The notation isn't very clear to me, but it seems like (6,3) could refer to the position of the zero in a matrix? And then 3 [[1]] makes me think there's a submatrix or maybe some operation applied three times?

Moving on, there are several similar lines: (1 (7, 1) ...), (1 (8, 3)...), and so forth. These might be different parts of the same structure with zeros at different positions and possibly different submatrices involved.

Then I see a line that says (2 (12,0) (12x12) 6 [[1,...1]]). Wow, okay, this seems like a larger matrix where a zero is at position (12,0), which might be the start of a row or column. The size is 12x12, and there's an operation applied six times with all ones in each part.

There are more lines with numbers like 8, 7, etc., followed by coordinates and other numbers. I'm getting lost here; maybe these are parts of different operations or transformations on the matrix?

I also notice a lot of [[1]], which probably means some kind of structure where each element is one, possibly an identity matrix or a vector of ones.

Wait, now that I think about it, this might be related to linear algebra or something with matrices. Maybe these are transformation steps involving zeroing out certain elements and replacing others? Or perhaps eigenvectors?

Hold on, let's try breaking it down more carefully. The first part is [0 followed by eight 1s], which could represent a vector where the sixth element is zero and the rest are one.

Then each subsequent bracket seems to describe another such vector with zeros at different positions—like (6,3), (7,1), etc. Maybe these vectors are being combined or transformed in some way?

The numbers after that, like 3 [[1]], might refer to operations applied: maybe multiplying by a matrix three times where each part is all ones? That could be an operation like creating a matrix with all ones and applying it thrice.

But why would they have different sizes for these submatrices—like some are 2x2, others 3x5 or even 12x12?

Also, the notation (12x0) is mentioned in one part. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because matrices are defined by their rows and columns, so it should be something like 12x12.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I need to think about what each of these brackets represents. The first bracket is the main vector with eight elements: [0,1,1,...], which could correspond to a matrix column or row.

The next lines seem to describe operations on this structure—maybe applying transformations that zero out different positions and then fill in others with ones? It's hard to say without more context.

Perhaps these are steps from Gaussian elimination or some kind of LU decomposition where they're zeroing elements above or below the diagonal. But I'm not sure how the numbers like (6,3) come into play here.

Alternatively, maybe this is related to sparse matrices where only certain positions are non-zero, and others are being set to one. The zeros might represent missing data points or something similar.

Wait a second, looking at the last part: 2 (12,0) (12x12) 6 [[1,...]]—this seems like they're creating a 12x12 matrix where all elements are ones except for position (12,0), which is zero. Then applying an operation six times? Or maybe it's setting up something with eigenvalues or eigenvectors?

This is getting too abstract without knowing the exact method used here. Maybe I need to look at some examples of how these operations work when zeros are introduced into matrices and then filled in.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about binary matrices where ones represent connections or entries, and they're performing some kind of transformation on them—like matrix inversion or multiplication.

But honestly, without more context or clear definitions for each symbol and operation used, it's really hard to pin down what exactly is being asked here. The problem just presents a jumble of numbers and mentions some operations but doesn't specify the goal or question clearly.

Wait, maybe I misread the original prompt? Let me check again.

Nope, it's all there: [0,1,...], several other arrays with zeros at different positions, then these (x,y) coordinate-based notations followed by numbers and matrix sizes. It seems like an incomplete description or perhaps a problem statement that is cut off.

If I have to make an educated guess, maybe the question is about identifying patterns in matrices where specific elements are zeroed out, and others are filled with ones through some operation. But without knowing what the operations are or what exactly needs to be found—like solving for eigenvalues or finding a determinant—it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps this is part of an algorithm, like the conjugate gradient method or something similar where you have steps that involve setting certain elements and applying transformations iteratively.

Given all these uncertainties, I think my best approach would be to outline what each part might represent in terms of linear algebra concepts. For instance:

1. The initial array [0 followed by eight 1s] could be a vector with mostly ones except for the sixth position being zero.
2. Each subsequent line describes another such vector but with zeros at different positions, maybe indicating where certain transformations are applied or not.
3. The numbers in parentheses like (6,3) might denote coordinates where operations start or stop—like setting elements to one after a certain point.
4. The parts following that involve submatrices of varying sizes, which could represent applying the same operation on different sections or components within a larger matrix.

But again, without knowing exactly what's being asked—for example, solving for something specific like eigenvalues, finding an inverse matrix, performing Gaussian elimination, etc.—it's hard to know how to proceed. 

Maybe I can think about similar problems I've encountered before where you have matrices with specific zero positions and operations that involve filling those zeros based on some rule or function.

For example, in sparse matrices, certain algorithms are designed to handle the non-zero elements efficiently by storing only their positions and values, which could be what's going on here. But again, without knowing the exact context, it's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about bitmasking where each element represents a bit, but that seems more like computer science than linear algebra.

In summary, I think these are parts of some matrix operations involving zeros at specific positions and creating submatrices or applying transformations on them. However, without clear definitions of the operations or the exact question, it's difficult to provide a precise answer.

If I had to make an educated guess based on standard problems in linear algebra, maybe this is about finding solutions to systems of equations represented by these matrices where certain variables (positions) are set to zero and others are solved for. But again, that's pure speculation without more information.

I might need to look up similar problems or examples where such patterns appear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a larger context like eigenvalue decomposition or something else in numerical linear algebra.

But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to stick with what I have and try to explain it as best as I can.

The problem involves analyzing several arrays of numbers and symbols, likely representing matrices. Each array has mostly ones except for a single zero at different positions. These zeros could indicate specific operations or transformations applied to the matrix structure.

1. The initial arrays represent vectors with a zero at varying positions (e.g., [0, 1, ..., 1], [1, 0, 1, ..., 1]). These might be part of an iterative process where zeros are strategically placed and filled in through operations.
2. Subsequent lines describe similar vectors but with zeros at different indices, possibly indicating the start or end of a transformation on specific sections within the matrix.
3. Notations like (6,3) could denote coordinates where transformations begin or stop, while numbers following indicate how many times an operation is applied (e.g., 3 [[1]] might mean applying an all-ones submatrix three times).
4. The mention of a 12x12 matrix with specific zero positions suggests a larger structure being built from smaller components, each filled with ones except for designated zeros.
5. Operations like (2 x operation six times) and references to eigenvalues or eigenvectors hint at more complex linear algebra processes.

Without clear definitions of the operations or the exact goal, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, these elements likely represent steps in solving systems of equations or performing matrix transformations, potentially involving sparse matrices or iterative methods like Gaussian elimination.

In summary, while the problem involves intricate patterns of zeros and ones within matrices, without additional context or specific questions, it remains speculative. Further details would be needed to provide an exact solution or analysis.
