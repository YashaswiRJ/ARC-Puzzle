User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I'm looking at this problem here where there are some input trees and corresponding output trees. It seems like each input tree is being transformed into an output tree in a specific way. My goal is to figure out the transformation rules so that I can apply them correctly.

First, let me parse what's given. The examples have structured input and output trees with nodes containing values and lists of child nodes or leaves (which are just lists). Each node has four parts: a value, two child indices, a size, and a list of children. 

Let me look at the first example to understand better.

**Train Example 1**

Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (4x7) 0 [[...], [...]])...

Wait, actually, looking closely, it's structured as:

Input Tree: (0 ... ) where inside is another tree with root value 0, children indices (0,0), size 4x7, and a list of child nodes.

Similarly, the output tree has a structure that seems to process these elements. 

Looking at Output Tree:
(0 (0,0) (4x3) ... )

Hmm, so it's reorganizing or transforming parts based on certain rules. The first step is probably understanding how each part is being transformed.

Breaking down an example:

Take the output tree from Train Example 1:

- Root value: 0
- Children indices: (0,0)
- Size: 4x3
- Children list:
    - Node with root value 3, children (1,0), size 2x3, etc.
    - Another node...

Wait, maybe the key is to see how the sizes are changing and which parts of the input tree are being used in the output.

In Input Tree example 1:

- The main structure after 0 has a child with value 4x7 (probably size), then another subtree starting at index 3.
- The corresponding Output Tree's first node also is under root 0, children indices (0,0), and size 4x3.

Wait, maybe the transformation involves aggregating or reorganizing based on the input structure. Alternatively, perhaps each value in the child list is being processed into a new tree.

Looking at the output nodes:

- One node with value 3 has children (1,0) which refers to index 1 of its own children.
- Another with value 5 and children indices (2,4).

Wait, maybe it's about how values are restructured or moved based on their size. Perhaps nodes in the input tree correspond directly but with different sizes.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should try to see if there's a pattern in how the sizes change from Input to Output.

In Train Example 1, input has (4x7), output is (4x3). So maybe when the size changes, some part of the list is being used or transformed into another structure.

Wait, looking deeper: The child under index 0 in input tree for example 1 has value [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] (4x7 matrix). In output, it's changed to a 3-row structure. So perhaps the size is being adjusted based on some rules.

Similarly, another part in input under index 3 has [[1], [1], [1], [1]] which becomes [[1],[1],[1]], so maybe reducing the number of layers or rows.

Alternatively, looking at the first output tree, after root 0:

- It has a child with value 3 and size 2x3.
- That seems to correspond to some part in the input tree. Maybe each node is being transformed into another structure based on its size parameters.

Wait, perhaps for each subtree starting at index i (like 1 or 2), we're creating new nodes where:

- The root value might stay the same.
- The size changes: for example, from 4x7 to something else.
- Then their children are being restructured into lists with certain dimensions.

This is a bit unclear. Maybe I should try to see how each part of the input tree maps to the output.

Looking at Train Example 2:

Input Tree:
(0 (0,0) ... )

Output Tree: same structure as before but some changes in sizes and children.

But perhaps it's easier if I look for a step-by-step transformation. Maybe each node is being transformed into another node where:

- The root value remains the same.
- The size parameters are adjusted based on certain rules (e.g., width or height).
- The child nodes get new indices or maybe some of their children are kept, others are replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how the lists under each node are being sliced or reshaped. For example:

In Train Example 1 Input Tree:

One subtree is [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] (size 4x7).

In Output Tree: this becomes a list of three rows with some structure.

Wait, maybe the size parameters are being used to determine how many children each node will have. So for example:

- A node with size 4x3 would have four rows and three columns? Or vice versa?

Alternatively, perhaps the first number is the height (number of rows) and the second is width (number of elements per row). So a 4x7 matrix has four rows each with seven elements.

In Output Tree example:

- The node under root 0 has size 4x3, so it's expecting to have three columns? Or maybe it's transposed?

Wait, that might be possible. Maybe the output is reshaping some parts of the input into a different shape (like transposing rows and columns) but only for certain subtrees.

Alternatively, perhaps each subtree starting at index 0,1,... are being processed differently based on their size parameters.

Another thought: Perhaps each node in the output tree corresponds to a part of the input tree where:

- The first child is used if its value is less than some threshold (like <4), and another branch for others.
But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how the children are being assigned new indices. For instance, index 0 in output might correspond to something from a different part of input.

This seems too vague. Maybe looking at more examples would help.

Looking at Train Example 2:

Input Tree:
(0 (0,1) ...) 

Output Tree has root value 3, children indices (2,4). Hmm, that's similar to the first output example but with a different index structure.

Wait, perhaps each subtree is being split into multiple nodes based on certain criteria. Like, if the size allows it, you create two new nodes for processing.

Alternatively, maybe when a node has more than one child, its children are further divided into smaller subtrees in the output.

But I'm not seeing a clear pattern yet. Maybe I need to think about how each value is being processed and restructured.

Wait, perhaps looking at specific parts would help:

In Train Example 1 Output Tree:

The first node after root has size 4x3, children indices (0,0) for its own subtree.

Then under this node's child index 0: another node with size 2x3, and so on.

Wait, maybe each time a node is processed, it creates two new nodes if certain conditions are met. Like splitting based on even and odd indices or something like that.

But perhaps the sizes determine how many children to have. For example:

- A 4x7 matrix (size) would create four rows with seven elements each.
- In output, maybe this is being split into two matrices of size 3x5 and another part?

Wait, in Train Example 1 Output Tree: a node under root has size 4x3. So perhaps it's not directly splitting the input but transforming based on some rules.

Alternatively, considering that the initial tree had indices (0,0) for one subtree and then more sub-subtrees, maybe each time you process a child index, you create new nodes with certain parameters.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: perhaps looking at how many children each node has can help determine the transformation rules.

For example:

- The root node in Output Tree 1 is (0 ...), which has two children indexed as (0,0).
- Each of these may correspond to processing specific parts from the input tree.

Wait, maybe it's about how the indices are being handled. For instance:

In Input Example 1: after the initial node at index 0, there's a subtree starting at index 3 with value [[1], [1], [1], [1]] (size 4x4?), which becomes in output something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each child index corresponds to moving parts of the tree into different positions.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to try to come up with possible transformation rules based on the given examples and then test them against other examples.

Let me hypothesize some rules:

1. For any node in the input tree starting at a certain index, its size parameters (like 4x7) are transformed into new sizes by reducing one of the dimensions or transposing.
2. Each child node is processed recursively with similar transformation rules applied to their own subtrees.

But without more examples, it's hard to be precise. Maybe I should look at how each input list is being converted.

Wait, perhaps looking at how lists are structured:

In Input Example 1: one subtree has [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] (4x7). In output, this becomes something like three rows, each with some elements. Maybe it's taking the first element of each row and creating a new list?

Alternatively, maybe transposing 4x7 into 7x4? But that would be more than just changing size.

Wait, in Output Example 1: after root, there is a node with children (0,0). Under this, another node has size 2x3. Maybe it's splitting the original list into two parts of equal length or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you process a child index, if its size allows for further splitting, you create new nodes accordingly.

But without clear rules, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I need to consider alternative explanations.

Another thought: Perhaps each node in the output tree corresponds to a way of reorganizing parts from the input tree into different substructures based on some criteria like even or odd indices.

Alternatively, maybe the transformation is about moving certain parts of the tree under different children nodes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe looking for how many new nodes are created per subtree can help determine a pattern.

For example:

In Output Example 1: After root node, two child subtrees at index (0,0). Then each of these may have their own child subtrees with different indices.

Perhaps the rule is that each node has exactly two children based on some criteria. So when processing an input subtree, it creates a new node with certain parameters and then splits into two parts for further processing.

But again, without knowing the exact transformation rules, this remains speculative.

Maybe to summarize: Each node in the output tree corresponds to transforming its associated part of the input tree's data according to specific size-based splitting or restructuring. The indices determine how these subtrees are connected or branched.

Perhaps I should try to see if each example follows a similar pattern regarding index assignments and sizes, then use that as a basis for transformation rules.

Wait, in Output Example 1:

- Root has two children at (0,0) and (2,3). Then under these, further splits happen with indices like (0,1), etc.

It seems each node creates more child nodes based on some index criteria. Maybe the size determines how many times you can split it or something similar.

But without a clear rule, I'm stuck.

Perhaps another approach: Assume that for any node starting at an index i in the input tree, its output subtree is processed by creating new nodes with certain indices and sizes derived from the original's size.

For example:

If input has child index 0 with size m x n, then in output, it might create two nodes under this parent: one with index (a,b) for each half of m or n. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe looking at how many children a node can have is key here. Maybe if the number of elements allows splitting into even and odd parts based on some criteria like rows vs columns.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation depends on whether the size parameters are greater than certain thresholds (like 4), in which case they split into two new nodes.

But again, without more examples or clearer rules, it's hard to define precisely.

Maybe I should consider that each node with a size of m x n will produce children based on some function f(m,n). For example:

If m >=n, create one child; if not, another. Or split into two parts: floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2).

Alternatively, for even m/n, you can split equally.

But in the first output example, the root node has size 4x3, which is greater than some threshold, so it splits into more nodes.

Wait, let's think of this as a binary tree structure where each node either remains as is or splits into two children based on its size. For instance:

If a node has m x n >=5, it creates two children: one with floor(m/2) and another with ceil(n). Or something like that.

But without seeing more examples, this is just speculative.

In the first output example, nodes at (0,0) have sizes 4x3 and then under them are split into 2x5 or similar. It's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe each node's size is transformed by a specific function to get new sizes for its children. For instance:

- m x n becomes two nodes with sizes (m/2)x(n), and ((m+1)/2)x(n) if m is odd.
But not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, in the first output example: root 4x3 splits into something else. Maybe it's being split along one dimension? For instance:

If you have a matrix of size m x n (rows x columns), maybe you can split it vertically or horizontally to create smaller matrices.

But again, without knowing which way is chosen, hard to tell.

Another thought: Perhaps each child index corresponds to selecting every k-th element from the parent's data. For example:

If the original has 10 elements and a child at (i,j), maybe j selects certain positions based on i+ some calculation.

But again, without clear rules or examples, it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps the problem is intended to test knowledge of specific tree structures or algorithms like binary trees, heaps, or something else. Maybe each index corresponds to heap indices in a complete binary tree structure.

Wait! Heap representations often use an array where for node at position i:

- left child is 2i +1

- right child is 2i +2

Maybe that's related. So perhaps the transformation rules are based on heap-like indexing, which would be similar to how you create parent-child relationships in a binary heap.

So maybe each index pair (a,b) refers to some kind of traversal or node positioning in such a structure.

But let me test this idea with the examples.

In Output Example 1:

- Root has two children: indices (0,0) and (2,3).

Wait, if it's a heap-like structure starting at index 0, then for each parent i, you have left child as 2i+1 and right as 2i+2. So from root 0, left is 1, right is 2.

But in the example, under root (index 0), there are children at (0,0) and (2,3). Wait, that doesn't fit typical heap indexing unless it's using a different structure or mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps each index pair represents something else like levels of the tree. Maybe level-order traversal?

Wait, but in output example 1:

Root is processed with two children at indices (0,0) and (2,3). Then under (0,0), there are more nodes: (0,1), then maybe splitting further.

This might be a representation using some other indexing system or data structure where the index pairs denote specific connections rather than direct heap-like positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to reorganize elements into different heaps or structures within the main tree. Maybe each node is responsible for a certain segment of the original array and splits further when necessary.

But without more examples or clear rules, I can't be sure.

Another approach: Assume that the size m x n determines how many times you split a node into children until certain conditions are met (like all sizes being below a threshold). Maybe each time you have to check if it's possible to fit into a certain structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about splitting along one dimension only when necessary. For example, if the number of rows is even, split vertically; else, do something else.

But again, not sure.

Wait, in Output Example 1:

- Root node has children (0,0) and (2,3). Then under (0,0), there's a child at (0,1). Under (0,1), maybe two more: like (4,5) or similar. So perhaps each split creates new nodes whose indices are calculated based on the original parent's index.

Alternatively, it might be that when you have a node with size m x n:

- If m > some threshold, split into left and right children along columns.

But I'm not sure without more info.

Wait, maybe this is about creating a binary space partitioning tree (BSP) where each node splits the space based on certain criteria. But again, unclear.

Given all these uncertainties, perhaps it's best to consider that the transformation rules are as follows:

- Each parent node can have up to two children.

- The child nodes' indices and sizes are determined by splitting the original data in some way (like even or odd splits along rows/columns).

But without precise rules, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern between input size and output index/size relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps each node with an index i in the parent can spawn children at indices 2i+1 and 2i+2, similar to heap structures. So let's see:

In Output Example 1, root is processed as (0). Its children would be (0*2+1)=1 and (0*2+2)=2.

But in the output example, the first level has two nodes: (0,0) and (2,3), which doesn't fit heap indices unless it's a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe each index is part of a tuple that represents some traversal order or connection within the tree. But again, without knowing how these are calculated, it's difficult to proceed.

Perhaps I should look for another angle: perhaps the problem is related to parsing expressions with trees and transforming them into ASTs (abstract syntax trees), where indices represent node positions in such a structure.

Alternatively, maybe each index pair corresponds to left or right children based on some condition. For example:

If size m x n >=4, split into two nodes at certain positions; else leave as is.

But without more examples, it's hard to figure out the exact pattern.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps I should outline possible steps for solving such a problem, even if I can't determine the exact transformations.

Step 1: Understand how tree indices are represented. For example, in heap-like structures, each node has specific child positions. In other structures like B-trees or binary trees, children may be determined by splitting criteria.

Step 2: Determine from examples how a parent's index leads to its children's indices and sizes.

For Output Example 1:

- Root (index 0) produces two children: (0,0) and (2,3). Wait, perhaps the first element is related to left child, the second to right or something else. Or maybe it's a different way of mapping parent to children.

But without more data points, it's hard to see a pattern.

Perhaps in this problem, each node's index pair indicates some hierarchical structure where the first number represents the level, and the second represents the position within that level. But again, unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps indices correspond to specific coordinates or positions in a grid being processed by the tree, which splits along rows and columns based on certain rules.

But without knowing more about how these trees are constructed from data, it's challenging.

Another thought: Maybe this is related to quad-trees where each node can have up to four children. But again, indices would need to reflect that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves building a k-ary tree or some other specialized tree type, and determining how nodes split into multiple children based on data size.

But without knowing the exact rules governing the transformation from one index pair to another, it's difficult to model.

Perhaps the key is in the sizes. For instance, if a node has a size that can be divided evenly along rows or columns, then split accordingly; else don't split further.

For example:

- If m x n >=4 and even: split into two nodes with adjusted sizes.

But again, without seeing more examples, I can't confirm.

Given the time spent, perhaps it's best to hypothesize that each node in a tree is responsible for a certain sub-region of the original data, determined by splitting along rows or columns when necessary. The indices likely represent some kind of spatial subdivision within the data structure.

Therefore, to solve this problem:

1. Analyze how the size (m x n) determines whether and how the node splits into children.

2. Determine if the split is along rows, columns, or both.

3. Figure out how the new child nodes' indices are assigned based on their position in the parent's subdivision.

4. Apply these rules iteratively to build the entire tree structure from root down.

But without concrete examples or transformation rules, this remains speculative.
</think>

To solve the problem of transforming data into a tree structure with specific index mappings, we can hypothesize that each node splits its region along rows and columns when necessary based on size. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Node Splitting Condition**: A node with dimensions (m x n) will split if it meets certain criteria, such as being larger than a threshold or not fitting evenly into the tree structure.

2. **Splitting Along Rows/Columns**: When splitting, decide whether to split along rows or columns based on which dimension allows for even division without remainder.

3. **Assigning Child Indices**: After determining how to split, assign child indices reflecting their position in the hierarchical subdivision (e.g., left and right children, depending on split direction).

4. **Recursive Construction**: Apply this process recursively to each node until no further splitting is needed or meets the termination criteria.

By following these steps, we can construct the desired tree structure with appropriate index mappings based on size considerations.
