User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I have this input tree that someone named "Test Example" provided. It looks a bit complicated with all these parentheses and numbers. My goal is to understand what it represents and figure out how to process or interpret it.

First, let me try to parse the structure of this tree. It seems like each part is enclosed in parentheses, which probably denotes some kind of node in a tree structure. Each node has elements separated by commas, so I can think of them as nodes with children.

Looking closer, there's something that says (0 (0, 0) (17x18) ...). Maybe this represents a node where the first child is another node with two zeros, and then another child which is "17x18". The "17x18" might be indicating some kind of multiplication or maybe dimensions. 

Then I see [[0,...]], there are multiple arrays filled with zeros. There are 16 such arrays, each containing sixteen zeros. That's quite a lot of zero elements. Maybe this is representing a specific part of the tree where all children are zeros.

Further down, there are nodes like (4 (4,2) (1x1) 1 [[1]] ), which seems to have two children: one with 4 and 2, another with "1x1" and then some array [1]. This pattern repeats a few times.

I'm also seeing numbers like 4, 12, 15, etc., attached in parentheses. Maybe these are identifiers for the nodes or part of their properties.

The last part mentions (4 (15,12) (1x1) 4 [[1]] ), which is similar to the earlier ones but with different numbers. It seems like each node has a combination of children and some kind of value attached, maybe weights or something else.

I'm not entirely sure what this tree represents. Could it be part of a mathematical structure, like matrices? Or perhaps it's a data structure used in programming for something specific. The presence of "17x18" suggests matrix dimensions since x is often used to denote multiplication and 17 rows by 18 columns.

The arrays filled with zeros make me think that maybe this tree represents some form of sparse matrices where most elements are zero, except for a few non-zero values represented by the [[1]] parts. This could be useful in linear algebra computations or graph theory representations like adjacency matrices.

But wait, each node has multiple children, and those children have their own structures. So it's not just a flat list of zeros but a hierarchical structure where each level branches out into more nodes with their own properties. Maybe this is representing something like an expression tree in programming, where operations are nested within each other.

Another possibility is that this tree could be part of some kind of graph or network topology, where each node represents a component and its children represent connections to other components. The "1x1" might indicate the type of connection or a specific edge with weight 1.

The numbers like (4,2), (15,2), etc., are confusing me a bit. If I think in terms of matrices, these could be row and column indices. For example, a 4x2 matrix would have 4 rows and 2 columns. But how does this fit into the overall structure?

The repeated pattern where each node has children that include numbers and arrays makes me think it's building up to something complex, maybe multiple layers of matrices or nested data structures. Each level adds more detail until we reach specific values like [[1]] which might be terminating nodes.

I'm also noticing that some parts have "0" as a child, while others have numerical values like 4 or 2. This inconsistency makes it harder to pinpoint the exact type of structure. It could mean different operations at each node, some adding zeros and others performing calculations.

The entire input seems quite extensive with multiple levels of nodes and arrays. If I were to visualize this, it would be a tree with many branches, each leading to another set of nodes until we reach the [[1]] leaves. This structure might represent something like a decision tree or a complex algorithm's flowchart where various paths are evaluated.

In terms of processing this input, if I were writing code, I'd probably need to parse it recursively since trees are typically handled with nested functions or recursive data structures. Each node would be an object containing its own children and possibly some attributes attached to it like the 4x12 or 15x2 mentioned.

The presence of multiple zero arrays could indicate parts where certain conditions aren't met, so those branches might not contribute anything significant. On the other hand, nodes with [[1]] likely represent terminal points or specific operations that yield a value of 1.

I'm still unclear on the exact purpose of this tree without more context, but it seems to be an intricate hierarchical structure with numerical and array components at each node. It could be used for data storage, computation, or representation of complex systems.

To summarize my thoughts: This is a nested tree structure with nodes containing both numerical values and arrays of zeros. Each node branches out into multiple children, some representing operations (like 17x18) and others being terminal leaves [[1]]. The presence of varying numbers like 4, 12, 15 suggests it's part of a larger system or computation involving matrices or hierarchical data.

If I were to approach this problem methodically, I'd start by parsing the tree structure recursively. Each node would be processed to extract its children and then their respective values. Identifying patterns within the numerical and array components might provide more insight into what this tree represents.

Additionally, considering that some nodes have consistent structures (like multiple arrays of zeros) while others have variable numerical values could indicate different states or modes within the system being modeled by this tree.

Overall, my understanding is limited by the lack of context, but breaking down the structure and analyzing each component step by step seems like a feasible approach to comprehending its purpose and function.
</think>

The input provided represents a nested tree structure where each node contains children nodes. The tree includes numerical values (e.g., 4, 12) that likely represent dimensions or identifiers, and arrays of zeros which could indicate sparse matrices or terminal states. Terminal nodes are represented by arrays containing the value 1.

To parse this structure:

1. **Start with the root node**: It has children such as a node with values (0, 0), another with "17x18", and an array of sixteen zeros.

2. **Recursive processing**: Each child is processed recursively to handle nested structures, extracting numerical identifiers or terminal arrays.

3. **Identify patterns**: Numerical identifiers might relate to matrix dimensions or operations, while terminal arrays (e.g., [1]) could represent specific states or results in a computational context.

4. **Contextual understanding**: Without additional context, the tree appears to be part of an intricate hierarchical data structure with potential applications in mathematics, graph theory, or algorithm representation.

This approach allows for systematic analysis and processing of each component within the nested tree, aiding in understanding its overall structure and purpose.
