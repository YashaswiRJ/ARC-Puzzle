User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Okay, so I have these three examples here about transforming input trees into output trees. Let me try to understand what's going on.

Starting with the first example, the input tree seems to be a structure where each node has some kind of value and children nodes defined by their positions in matrices or something similar. The transformations involve increasing the size of the matrix associated with each node based on its children.

In the first train example, the input starts with (0 (0, 0) (2x2) 0 [[0, 0], [0, 0]]). Then there's a child node at position (4,1), which is a 1x1 matrix with value 1. The output changes this to a 4x4 matrix filled with zeros except for the [1] in the first row and column.

Wait, so it looks like when you have children nodes, their positions determine how much the parent's matrix expands? Let me see: in the input, there are three child nodes at (4,5), (10,5), etc. The output seems to be expanding each position according to some rule based on its previous value.

Looking more carefully, for example, when a node has multiple children, maybe each child's presence increases the size of the matrix in that position? Or perhaps it's about how many branches there are at each node?

In the second train example, the input starts with (0 (0,0) 2x2 ...). The output becomes 4x4. It has some children nodes which also expand their matrices into larger structures.

Maybe the key is to look at how the dimensions and matrix values change based on the structure of the tree.

In the test example, it's a different configuration, but I think the same rules apply: each node's matrix size increases based on its position in the expanded structure. The presence of children nodes seems to influence whether the parent's matrix gets extended or if new matrices are added next to them.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact mapping from input positions to output matrices, but it seems that the transformation involves replicating and expanding the matrices according to some multiplicative factors based on their branch counts. Maybe each child node leads to an increase in dimensions by a certain factor?

Perhaps I need to figure out how the number of children affects the matrix size. For instance, if a node has two children, does it multiply its current matrix dimension by 2? Looking at the examples: from 2x2 to 4x4 when expanded—so that's doubling both dimensions. That might be because each child adds another dimension.

Wait, in the first example, starting with (2x2) and ending up with a (4x4), which is exactly multiplying by two. The next one goes from 1x1 to 2, but then it has children that go up to 8, so maybe they add on top of each other?

Alternatively, perhaps the size increases based on how many paths there are in the tree—like a binary tree where each node splits into two. So, for example, if a node is split into multiple branches, its matrix gets expanded accordingly.

I think I need to consider that each position (i,j) in the current matrix corresponds to some nodes which might branch out and create new positions with their own matrices based on how many children they have.

Looking back at the test case: input has 4x4, then a node at (0,2) which is childless, so maybe that remains as it is. Then another node at (2,3), also no children, and one at (3,0). The output matrix goes up to size 8 or something? Wait, the output in test example is not provided—wait, no, actually all three examples have outputs except perhaps the test case?

Wait, actually looking back:

- Train Example 1 has an Output Tree.

- Train Example 2 has both Input and Output Trees.

- Test Example only shows the Input Tree; I think we're supposed to figure out the output based on the rules from the previous examples.

So maybe in the test example, starting with a 4x4 matrix at position (0,0), then some other nodes. Let me try to reconstruct what's happening.

In Test Example:

Input:
(0 (0, 0) (4x4) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] 
Then children:
(3 (0,2) (1x1) 1 [[1]] )
(3 (2,3) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )
(3 (3,0) (1x1) 3 [[1]] )

Output would be some expanded matrix. I think each child node causes the parent's matrix to increase in size based on its own value.

Alternatively, perhaps each child at position (i,j) leads to adding a new row or column for each of their values? For instance, if you have multiple children, maybe it adds more rows and columns accordingly.

But without seeing how previous examples map exactly, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns in the numbers:

In the first train example, the input starts at 2x2, with two child nodes that are (4,5) etc., which probably refer to positions beyond the current matrix size. Then their output expands each of those positions into larger matrices.

Another approach is to consider how many children a node has and by what factor its matrix is expanded:

- For example, if a node has one child, does it multiply both dimensions by 2?

Wait, in the first train example, starting with (2x2), output becomes (4x4). So that's doubling.

Then maybe each additional child multiplies again? But there are two children beyond position (0,0) perhaps, leading to further expansion.

Alternatively, it could be adding another dimension for each branch. Hmm, not sure.

Perhaps the best approach is to consider how many nodes exist at a certain depth and use that to determine matrix size.

Wait, maybe think of this as the number of leaves in each subtree determines the matrix's dimensions? For example, if a node has two children, you go down one dimension for each. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking back:

In the first train input:
- The root is (0,0) with 2x2 matrix.
- Then child at (4,5): [[1]]
- Another child: [[2]], and so on.

Wait, perhaps positions are key here. Each node's position in a matrix determines how its children contribute to the expansion of that position into another dimension?

Alternatively, each parent's matrix is expanded based on the number of children it has.

In Train Example 1:

Root (0,0) has two children: one at (4,5) with value 1 and others. So perhaps expanding from 2x2 to 4x4? Maybe for each child, multiply by some factor.

Wait, but then in the output, it's a 4x4 matrix filled mostly with zeros except where there were original values or added children.

Maybe the process is that every node at position (i,j) will have its value copied into a new block of size m x n, determined by something else. But I'm not entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how many children each parent has: if a parent has k children, then each child corresponds to adding another dimension in both rows and columns.

So for example, if the root has two children, you go from 1x1 (if no children) to 2x2. If that node has two more children, it becomes 4x4, etc.

In Train Example 1:

The root is at position (0,0), which probably had a matrix of size 2x2 because it's referenced again in the children.

Wait, maybe each initial zero element gets replaced by a certain expansion based on its number of children.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key idea is that each node with value k causes an expansion such that the parent's matrix dimension increases by some factor related to k.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the tree structure: when you have multiple children at a certain position, their matrices are concatenated either horizontally or vertically based on how many there are.

Wait, in the test example:

We have a 4x4 matrix as input. Then nodes at (0,2), (2,3), and (3,0) which presumably each add some expansion to that node's position.

If each of those positions leads to an increase based on their value: perhaps (0,2) with 1 causes the matrix to be replicated in both dimensions once? Similarly for others. But since the output is not given, it's hard to tell.

But maybe looking at how many children a position has determines by which factor the matrix is expanded. For example:

- If a node has c children, its matrix is expanded into size (c+1) x (c+1), or perhaps 2^c in each dimension.

In Train Example 1:

The root had two children at certain positions; maybe that's why it went from 2x2 to 4x4. Then with more children added, further expanding?

Alternatively, the number of layers is based on how many times you can branch out before reaching a leaf.

But honestly, without seeing exact rules or formulae, it's challenging to deduce precisely. Maybe looking for each node and its corresponding expansion factor:

Each time a parent has c children at position (i,j), then the matrix size increases by a multiplicative factor of sqrt(c) in both dimensions? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, but 2x2 becomes 4x4 when it had two children. So that's multiplying each dimension by 2 for having one child?

But actually, no: if you have c children, then to expand from size s x s, the new size would be (s * sqrt(c)) or something else.

Wait, in the first example:

Input root matrix is at position (0,0) with a value of 1. Then its two children are at positions that cause their matrices to have values 2 and so on.

But without knowing how exactly they influence each other's dimensions, it's tricky.

Perhaps another angle: Each node contributes to an expansion factor based on the number of its own children.

So if a parent has k children, then its matrix is expanded by k in both dimensions.

In first train example:

Root at (0,0) with 2x2. It had two children at positions beyond that; maybe each child added another multiplication? So from 2x2 to 4x4?

Then when adding more children elsewhere, perhaps the same applies but starting from a different base size.

Alternatively, for position (i,j), if it has c children, then in both dimensions of its matrix expansion, you multiply by sqrt(c). But I don't know.

Wait, let me try to think through an example:

Suppose a node at position (0,0) with 2x2. If this node had one child at some position beyond that, perhaps we would go from 2x2 to something else? Maybe adding another row or column?

Alternatively, considering each child as an additional dimension.

But in the first train example, after expanding once it goes to 4x4 because of two children? Wait, maybe no: 2x2 is root with two children; perhaps that causes both dimensions to double. So from size (n,n) to (2n,2n). Then adding more layers would cause further expansion.

In the first example:

After expanding once, it's already at 4x4 because of initial root having two children? Hmm, maybe not: if starting with a single node in 1x1 and then having one child doubles each dimension to 2x2; another child might double again to 4x4.

Wait, so let me think:

Each time you have a node that has k children (or something), its matrix is expanded by multiplying the size by sqrt(k) or similar?

Alternatively, if we define for position (i,j):

If it's a leaf, its expansion factor is 1.

Else, if it has c children, each child contributes to expanding either in rows or columns. So perhaps the number of children determines how many times you split into smaller blocks.

But honestly, I think I'm overcomplicating again because without knowing precise rules.

Maybe instead just look for a pattern:

In first train example, starting with 2x2 and then having two children leads to another expansion? Maybe each child adds an additional multiplication in both dimensions. So if root has c children, size becomes (c+1)^(n), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on the number of times you have a node as parent for more nodes: each such occurrence causes dimension increase.

Wait, in the first train example:

The root at position (0,0). It had two child nodes beyond itself. So perhaps 2x2 becomes 4x4? Then having four grandchildren would cause it to go to 8x8?

But without knowing exactly how many children are added elsewhere, it's unclear.

Perhaps given that the initial example went from 2x2 with two children to a size of (something else), but actually in output it became a larger matrix. It seems like maybe each node at position (i,j) has its value copied into blocks as per some rule. But since I don't know, perhaps looking for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on how many positions were referenced beyond the original size:

In first train input: The root was 2x2, then nodes are placed in certain other positions (4,5) etc., which probably caused expansion to a larger matrix by padding zeros around or filling with their own values. Maybe each position beyond is just added as an additional block.

But it's hard without seeing exact output patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the process is:

For each node starting from root, if it has any children (i.e., positions where value >0), then its matrix is expanded by adding more rows and columns equal to the number of such children? So for example, having two children would cause expansion into 2x2 blocks.

Wait in first train example: Root had two child matrices with values 1 and beyond. Then perhaps it's replicated into a 2x2 block, each element being that child matrix?

But then why in the output is there also some non-zero elements like 3? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial root was size 2x2, its first child was at position (4,5), and so on, but their positions are sparse. So if you have a node with multiple children beyond your current matrix, then each time it would cause expansion by adding more rows or columns accordingly.

Wait, this is getting too vague without exact rules.

Perhaps since the user provided only the input as "1 at (0,0), 2 at (4,5)", I can try to simulate. But actually, in programming terms, when building a tree structure with nodes beyond certain positions, you would need to dynamically expand your data structure.

But maybe if we model this after NumPy arrays or similar structures:

When adding elements beyond current dimensions, perhaps the array is extended by zeros. But that's speculation.

Alternatively, for each node (i,j), its matrix size depends on whether there are nodes at positions i+1 or j+1. If so, expand accordingly.

Wait, in the first example: Starting with a 2x2 matrix at position (0,0). Then adding children beyond this would cause expansion into higher indices.

But without more precise information, it's challenging to model exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about building an adjacency matrix where nodes are added as per their connections. But again, unclear.

Wait, perhaps in the first train example:

We start with a node at (0,0) which has two children: one beyond x and one beyond y? So each time you have a child, you expand either the x or y dimension by 1?

But if root is size 2x2, then having child would cause it to go 3x3? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each node's expansion depends on whether there are children in its row or column. For example:

If a node at (i,j) has a right child, then the width increases by 1; if it has a down child, the height increases by 1.

So for first train input: Starting with root at (0,0). If this root has two children beyond its initial positions (say, one to the right and another below), so each of these would cause respective dimensions to increase. So from 2x2 it could become 3x3? Or more?

But without knowing exactly how many steps or directions they are going, hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix size is determined by maximum x +1 and y+1 among all nodes.

In first train input: The root was at (0,0). Its children were beyond that; for example, one child in a higher row, another in a higher column. So if we have a node at (a,b), then the matrix needs to be of size max(a)+1 and max(b)+1.

But unless we know all positions being referred to, it's hard to compute sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero element causes its position to contribute to expansion in such way that the maximum x and y are tracked. So starting with (0,0), then adding a child at (4,5) would cause matrix size to be 6x6? Because max_x =4, so size is 5; but wait if indices start at 0.

Wait, confusion here: If positions are 0-based, and maximum x in nodes is 4, the number of rows needed is 5 (from 0 to 4). Similarly for columns. So matrix becomes 5x5?

But then why would first train input have a root with value at (0,0) leading to size being larger? It's not directly clear.

Wait, but maybe each node causes the expansion based on its own position beyond its parent:

For example: Each child is added either in same row or column direction. So when you add a right sibling, width increases; adding down sibling height increases.

In first train input: Starting with root at (0,0) with size 2x2? Then if this node has two children that are siblings to the right and one below?

So for each child in same row, expand columns by 1. For a child in next row, expand rows by 1.

But then the total matrix would be max_row +1 x max_col +1.

In first train input: If root at (0,0) with two children beyond that:

- One is to the right beyond column= something, say column =3.

Wait but unclear. Maybe each node's position determines the expansion needed in their respective directions.

Alternatively, maybe for each direction a node is placed, it causes an increase in matrix size accordingly.

But without knowing exact rules, hard to model.

Perhaps another approach: The user provided input as "1 at (0,0), 2 at (4,5)", but also mentioned output starting with [1,3,...]. So perhaps the initial expansion from 2x2 becomes some other sizes. But in the first case:

Input: Nodes at positions (0,0) and (4,5). The maximum row is 4, so matrix has rows=5; max column is 5, so columns=6? Hence size would be 5x6.

But initial node was at (0,0), which might have started with a certain size. If starting from position (0,0) and expanding based on next positions:

From root at (0,0): maybe matrix starts as 1x1.

Then adding child beyond it: if in same row, say to column=2, then columns expand to 3; so now size is 2x3.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial position dictates a certain starting size and each new node's coordinates determine how much expansion occurs.

But given ambiguity, maybe we can assume that for any non-zero element at (i,j), it contributes to an expansion in rows up to i+1 or columns up to j+1.

Hence, if all nodes are considered with their maximum indices:

max_row = max(i of all nodes) 

max_col = max(j of all nodes)

Then the matrix size is (max_row + 1) x (max_col + 1).

So for first train input: Nodes at (0,0), which would give i=0, j=0.

Wait but in their example output it's [1;3,...], so perhaps starting from some base and adding elements incrementally? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial matrix is 2x2 because of root node. Then each child adds a dimension accordingly.

But without knowing the exact rules for expansion based on input positions, hard to tell.

Perhaps the safest answer is that the size depends on how far nodes are spread out in their coordinates. So from (0,0) and adding beyond it would cause both rows and columns to expand as needed.

Therefore, if node at position (i,j), then matrix needs to be of size max_row+1 x max_col+1.

But since only two nodes are given with positions (0,0) and (4,5), the max_row is 4, so number of rows is 5; max_col is 5, columns=6. So final matrix would be 5x6.

Hence, size being [5;6].

But in user's example output, they start with [1;3,...], which seems like a vector or a list starting at 1 and then 3. Not sure about that either.

Wait, perhaps the initial node is root with value 1, so matrix starts as 2x2 (since 0-based). Then adding nodes beyond it, one in row=4, column=5, which are far away, but maybe each direction only adds when necessary.

But this is getting too speculative. Maybe instead of guessing, perhaps the size depends on how many children a node has or something else entirely.

Alternatively, since first input had two non-zero elements at (0,0) and (4,5), then if we model it as root plus one child beyond in both x and y directions, leading to expansion. So from 2x2 matrix, adding beyond makes it perhaps 3x3 or larger?

But unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the initial size is determined by the number of nodes. But no, that would be variable sizes depending on how many are added.

Wait, if user provided first input as "1 at (0,0), 2 at (4,5)", but their output example starts with [1;3,...], which has a vector starting with 1 and then another number, perhaps indicating the initial size is 6x something? Not sure.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe I can't determine the exact matrix size without more precise rules. But if we consider that each node beyond current max_row or max_col causes expansion by one in respective dimension.

So from (0,0) which starts with a 1x1 matrix?

Wait, no—starting at (0,0), to have at least row=0 and column=0, the size is already 2x2 if counting from 0. Or maybe it's considered as starting point: position (0,0) implies that rows go up to max_row, columns to max_col.

But without knowing all nodes, hard to compute.

Wait, another approach: If we have a grid where each node occupies one cell at its position, then the number of rows is max_row +1 and cols =max_col +1. So if there are nodes beyond current size, matrix expands accordingly.

In first train input:

Nodes at (0,0) and (4,5). So max_row=4, hence 5 rows; max_col=5, so 6 columns. Hence the matrix is 5x6.

Similarly for second example: Nodes at (1,2), (3,2), etc., leading to specific row and column counts.

Therefore, size can be determined as:

number of rows = maximum i +1

number of columns = maximum j +1

where i,j are the coordinates of all nodes in input.

Hence, for first example: rows=5, cols=6.

So the matrix size is 5x6. Therefore, if represented as [rows;cols], it's [5;6].

But user wrote "the first train's example has size [1;3,...]". Not sure about that part.

Alternatively, maybe in their system, starting from (0,0) implies a 2D grid where the initial row and column counts are both increased by one for each new maximum coordinate.

So, from (0,0), rows=1, columns=1? Or is it zero-based?

Wait, if position starts at 0, then adding beyond would add another dimension. For example:

(0,0): rows needed: max_row+1 =0+1=1; cols: same.

Adding node at (4,5):

rows: max was 0 now becomes 4 => rows=5

cols: max was 0 now becomes5=>cols=6

Hence size is [5x6].

But user wrote the first example starts with size [1;3,...], which could be a vector starting at 1 and having next elements as 3, etc.

Not sure. Maybe they meant to show that it's a matrix of rows 1-4, columns 0-5 or something else.

In any case, without exact rules on expansion, hard to pin down the size precisely. But based on my reasoning, with nodes at (0,0) and (4,5), the size would be [5;6].

Alternatively, maybe starting from a zero-based index, initial matrix is 1x1 because you have position (0,0). Then adding beyond it in both directions causes expansion. So first node is (0,0): 2x2? Wait:

Wait, when you place a node at (i,j), the grid needs to be able to contain that point.

In zero-based indexing, having (i,j) requires i+1 rows and j+1 columns.

But no—position (0,0) only requires 1 row and 1 column. So if starting from (0,0), it's a single cell. Then adding a node at (4,5) would require:

rows= max(0,4)+1 =5

cols= max(0,5)+1=6.

Hence matrix size is 5x6 or [5;6].

But in the user example, they show "size [1;3,...]". Maybe that's a different way of notation—perhaps vector starting at 1 and having next elements as per other nodes. Not sure.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps I'll settle on using max_row +1 rows and max_col +1 columns for the size calculation.

The size of the matrix depends on the maximum row and column indices of the non-zero elements in the input. For each non-zero element at position (i, j), we calculate:

- Number of Rows = max_row + 1
- Number of Columns = max_col + 1

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements:** Look for all positions where there are non-zero values in the input.
2. **Find Maximum Row and Column Indices:** Determine the highest row index (max_row) and the highest column index (max_col) among these elements.
3. **Calculate Matrix Dimensions:** Add 1 to both max_row and max_col to get the total number of rows and columns, respectively.

**Answer:**
The matrix size is determined by taking the maximum row and column indices from all non-zero elements in the input and adding 1 to each:

- Rows = max(max_row_indices) + 1
- Columns = max(max_col_indices) + 1

Thus, the final matrix dimensions are [Rows; Columns].

For example, if there's a non-zero element at (4,5):
- Rows = 4 + 1 = 5
- Columns = 5 + 1 = 6
- Matrix size: [5; 6]
