User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

Bot: <think>
Alright, so I've got this problem in front of me, and honestly, it's a bit confusing at first glance. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, looking at the input example provided, there are these parentheses with numbers and other stuff inside them. It seems like some kind of structured data or maybe even an XML-like format. I notice things like (2 (1, 6) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ), which probably represents something in a tree structure.

I see that the input is a test example with a specific tree configuration. The first part is a big tuple starting with 0 and containing several nested tuples. Each of these seems to represent nodes in some kind of graph or tree, maybe an adjacency list?

Then there's this line: "Test Example Input Tree:" followed by another structure that looks similar but different. It starts with (0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]), which is probably the main node with two children.

I think each of these tuples represents a node in a tree where:
- The first number is the value of the node.
- The next part inside parentheses are its children or something similar.
- There's also some matrix notation, like [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which could represent an adjacency matrix for that node.

Looking at the example provided after the test case:
(2 (1,6) (1x1) 2 [[1]])
This likely means a node with value 2, children nodes 1 and 6, it's connected in some way represented by the 2x2 matrix? Or maybe the size of the adjacency matrix?

Another part is (3 (3,2) (6x4) 7 [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0],...]), which suggests a node with value 3, children nodes 3 and 2. The 6x4 might indicate something about the size or type of connections, maybe an adjacency matrix dimensions.

I'm trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done here. Is this part of some kind of graph traversal problem? Or is it related to parsing a specific format into a data structure?

Also, I notice that in both test examples, there's a lot of nesting with tuples and matrices. Maybe the task is to parse these structures into a tree or another format.

Wait, perhaps each node has attributes like its value, list of children, and an adjacency matrix describing connections between nodes.

So maybe the problem is to construct such a tree from the given input, interpreting the numbers as node values, their children, and using the matrices to define how they connect.

But then what's the goal? I mean, the user just provided these examples without specifying exactly what needs to be computed or transformed. Maybe I need to figure out based on common problems involving such structures.

Looking back at similar problems, perhaps it's about building an adjacency list or matrix from given tree nodes with their connections.

Alternatively, maybe this is related to graph theory, where each node has certain properties like being a leaf, internal node, etc., and we need to determine something like the degree of each node or connectivity patterns based on these matrices.

But without more specific instructions, it's challenging. However, considering that both test examples involve constructing trees with nodes connected via adjacency matrices (like [[1,0],[0,1]] which is an identity matrix), maybe the task is about building such a tree and performing operations like finding paths or connections based on these matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps each node has multiple properties: its value, children, type of node (leaf, internal), and its adjacency matrix. Maybe we need to compute something like the sum of all edges in the graph represented by these nodes?

Wait, looking at one part:
(2 (1,6) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )
The "1x1" might indicate a single connection between node 1 and 6? And the matrix [[1]] represents that there is an edge.

Similarly, in another case:
(3 (3,2) (6x4) 7 [[1,1,0,0],[...]])
Here, it's a 6x4 adjacency matrix with mostly ones except for some zeros. Maybe this indicates multiple edges from node 3 to nodes 2?

But I'm not sure. Since the problem is about parsing these structures, perhaps the task is to create an adjacency list where each node points to its connected nodes based on the matrices provided in their children.

Alternatively, maybe it's about determining which nodes are leaves and which are internal nodes by examining the structure of the tuples.

Another angle: the initial tuple is (0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]). The first part is a node with value 0, two children both 0. Then each child has its own tuple:

(0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]) and another similar one.

Wait, maybe the structure represents nodes where each node can have multiple children, but in these examples, they only have two? Or perhaps more?

But then again, without knowing exactly what to do, it's difficult. Maybe I should consider that this is about building a graph where each tuple defines a node with its connections given by matrices.

Given the complexity, perhaps the task is to implement a parser for such structures and build an adjacency list or matrix from them.

Alternatively, maybe we're supposed to find out how many edges are in the graph based on these nodes' connections defined in their children tuples.

But looking at the first test case:

(2 (1,6) (1x1) 2 [[1]] )
This could represent a node with value 2, connected to nodes 1 and 6. The adjacency matrix is size 1x1, which might mean it has one connection? Or maybe each element represents an edge.

But in the case of two nodes, 1 and 6, that would be a 2x2 adjacency matrix. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how these matrices are used.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers inside the matrices represent weights or something else.

Wait, let's look at another example:

(3 (3,2) (6x4) 7 [[1,1,0,0],[...]])
Here, nodes 3 and 2 are connected. The adjacency matrix is size 6x4, which seems odd because node numbers don't go up to 6 or 4 here.

Hmm, maybe the dimensions of the matrix correspond to something else rather than representing connections between specific nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps each number inside a node's tuple represents a different aspect: value, children count, type, and then some matrix related to its properties.

But I'm getting stuck because I don't know exactly what the problem is asking for. The user just provided these examples without specifying an explicit task.

If I had more context or clear instructions on what needs to be computed or parsed, it would help a lot. But as it stands, I might have to make some educated guesses based on standard graph parsing problems.

Perhaps the goal is to build an adjacency list where each node has its connections defined by these matrices. So for each child in a node's tuple, we extract their value and then use the matrix provided in that child's structure to determine how this node connects to others.

Alternatively, maybe it's about traversing the tree based on these nodes' properties or counting certain features like the number of edges, leaves, etc.

Wait, considering both test cases have a lot of 0s as children and matrices with mostly ones except some zeros, perhaps they are representing undirected graphs where each non-zero entry in the matrix indicates an edge between two nodes. So maybe we need to count how many edges exist based on these connections.

But again, without precise instructions, it's speculative.

In summary, I think this problem is about parsing a specific nested tuple structure into a graph or tree representation and then performing some operations based on that, such as counting edges, traversing the graph, etc. But since the exact goal isn't clear from the user's message, my initial approach would be to outline possible interpretations of these input structures.

Perhaps I should provide an adjacency list for both test examples after parsing them, showing how nodes are connected based on the matrices provided in their child tuples.

Alternatively, if it's about building a tree structure with specific properties (like node values and connections), then each tuple could represent a subtree where the first number is the root value, followed by its children as subtrees or something similar.

But without more details, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to ask for clarification or assume based on common problems.
</think>

It seems that this problem involves parsing nested tuples into a tree structure and constructing an adjacency list representation of the graph where each node's connections are defined by the matrices provided in their child tuples.

Here is an outline of how you might approach such a problem:

1. **Parse the Input**: Each tuple represents a node with its value, children, type (like 1x1 or 6x4), and possibly an adjacency matrix.
2. **Build an Adjacency List**:
   - For each node, use the provided matrices to determine connections between nodes.
   - For example, if a node's child has an adjacency matrix indicating edges to other nodes, add those edges to the graph.

Given that both test examples have zeros as children and mostly ones in their matrices except for some zeros, this might represent undirected graphs where each non-zero entry indicates an edge. Without specific instructions, I'll assume we're building such a representation.

Here's how you might present the adjacency list:

### Test Example 1:
The input starts with `0 (0, 0) (10x10) 0 [[...]]`.

This could represent a graph where nodes 0 and another node are connected based on their child tuples. However, due to the complexity and lack of specific instructions, providing an exact adjacency list is challenging.

### Final Answer:

To provide an accurate answer, more specific details about what exactly needs to be computed or parsed from these input structures would be needed.
