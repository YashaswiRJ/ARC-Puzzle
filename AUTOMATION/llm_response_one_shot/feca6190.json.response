User: Hey DeepSeek, let’s tackle a structured reasoning challenge!
You're exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition and logical reasoning, so I have an exciting task for you. Your goal is to learn the transformations that convert input tree to output tree, given few instances of input-output tree pairs. Next we will describe, how these trees look like, how to describe them in text and how transformations look like and how to describe them in text.

Understanding the Problem:
Input is a tree of shapes. Each shape becomes a tree node with attributes: Color-digit, Bounding box dimensions, Top-left corner position, Child details (nested shapes inside the bounding box)
The number 0 represents the background (if applicable).
Each distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels.
Some shapes are nested within others, forming a hierarchical structure, that is, In the tree, if two shape nodes are in a parent-child relationships, then it means that the child shape will be nested within parent shape if they are rendered on the 2D plane.

Defining the Tree Representation (these are tree of different shapes): To represent the matrix as a tree:
Identify distinct shapes using connected non-zero pixels (8-neighbours connectivity). Connected components have same color and can have some another connected component (shape) nested inside them.
Find the minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape. 
Hierarchy Rules:
A shape (child) must be fully contained within its parent's bounding box.
Children always have a higher z-index than their parent, meaning if two shapes overlap, the child’s color takes precedence over the parent’s color.
Each node of the tree has an attribute blueprint, which is the bitmask representation of the shapes present in the figure.
The answer should be structured as follows
(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)
The children should also be structured in a similar manner.

To facilitate structured and predictable tree transformations, we define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) containing a set of allowed tree operations. These operations modify the existing tree structure while ensuring structural integrity and logical consistency.
Each transformation must be deterministic, reversible when possible, and ensure that the tree remains valid after the operation. There are a total of 7 tranformations on the DSL as given below.

1. Add Node
Operation: Insert a new child node under an existing parent.
Parameters Required:[parent_id: Identifier of the existing parent node, node_id: Unique identifier for the new node, color: predefined pixel color value, position: Coordinates of top-left cell, dimensions: Dimension of bounding rectangle]

2. Translate (Shifting Position)
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, new_position: Updated coordinates (new_x, new_y)]
Operation: Adjusts the top-left position of the node in the matrix. 
Example: Translate(node_id, (new_x, new_y)):
...(color top_left_cell dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(color (top_left_cell: new_x, new_y) dimension unique_node_id [bitmask] children)

3. Rotation
Operation: Rotates the node’s shape by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise.
Parameters:[node_id: Target node, angle: Rotation angle (90, 180, 270).]
Effects: [The bounding box updates accordingly. The node’s blueprint updates to reflect the new orientation.]
Example: Rotation(node_id, 270):
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to ...(color transformed_top_left_cell (2x3) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]] children)

4. Mirroring (Reflection) 
Operation: Reflects a node along a certain axes. 
Types of Reflection: [horizontal_mirror: Flip left-to-right, vertical_mirror: Flip top-to-bottom, left_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, right_diagonal_mirror: Flip along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal] 
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, type: Type of reflection] 
Example 1: Mirroring(node_id, horizontal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1]] children)
Example 2: Mirroring(node_id, left_diagonal_mirror): 
....(color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]] children) transforms to .... (color top_left_cell (3x2) unique_node_id [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] children)

5. Flood_Fill (Inner Filling)
Operation: Fills an enclosed region inside a node’s blueprint, ensuring the boundaries remain unchanged.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node identifier]
Example: Flood_Fill(node_id):
....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children) transforms to ....(color top_left_cell (3x4) unique_node_id [[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]] children)

6. Change_Node_Color
Parameters: [node_id: Target node, new_color: Updated color value]
Operation: Change color attribute of the node.
Example: Change_Node_Color(node_id, new_color):
...(color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children) transforms to ...(new_color top_left_cell dimension [bitmask] children)

7. Remove Node
Operation: Deletes a specific node from the tree. The children of this node become the direct children of parent of this node.
Parameters: [node_id: Target node.]
Example: Remove_Node(2)
...(3 (0,0) (9x9) 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]  (4 (3,4) (4x2) 2 [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]])  (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]])) transforms to ...(3 (0,0) 9x9 1 [ [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]] (4 (3,7) (1x1) 3 [[1]]))
-------------------------------------------------------

Every operation follows a strict parameterized format, that is, the output should be given in the specified format.
Error handling should ensure logical consistency after each transformation.
Parent-child relationships must be preserved, except when explicitly modified.
This structured DSL ensures precise, predictable tree transformations while restricting the search space for LLM-driven modifications.

I will give a few example pairs of input-output tree along with one test input tree. I want you to identify the tree operations used in the examples and apply the same on the test input sequentially. The output should be a program, that is, a sequence of operations that you applied on test input in order to get the output tree. Make sure that you use only the tree operations that are described above.,

(0 (0, 0) (1x5) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] (6 (0, 1) (1x1) 1 [[1]] (7 (0, 2) (1x1) 2 [[1]] ) (8 (0, 3) (1x1) 3 [[1]] ) (9 (0, 4) (1x1) 4 [[1]] )))

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided some tree structures and examples of inputs and outputs, and they want to know how these transformations work. Specifically, looking at Train Example 3 and Test Example, I need to figure out what operations are being applied on the input trees to get the output trees.

First, let me parse the input and output trees.

Starting with Train Example 3:
Input Tree:
(0 (0, 0) (1x5) 0 [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] (9 (1, 1) (14x14) 1 [[0,0,..1...]]) )
Wait, the input seems to be a tree with multiple parts: root node is 0, left child is (0,0), right subtree has depth and other parameters. Similarly for the output.

Output Tree:
(9 (1,1) (14x14) 1 [[0,0,..1...]] (25 (1,0) (16x16) 0 [[..]]) )

So, looking at this, it seems that the main transformations are:

1. The root value increases from 0 to 9.
2. Some subtree parameters change, like dimensions changing from 14x14 to 16x16.

Now, moving to Test Example:
Input Tree: (0 (0,0) (1x5) 0 [[0,0,0,0,0]] ... )
But actually, the input is more complex with multiple branches. The output tree also has a similar structure but different values and parameters.

I think what's happening here is that each node in the tree might be undergoing some transformation based on its position or value. Perhaps, for example, nodes at certain depths are being modified by appending zeros or shifting their values.

Looking at the first subtree in Train Example 3: (9 (1,1) (14x14) ...). The output has a similar structure but with increased dimensions. So maybe each time a node is processed, its parameters like depth and width increase based on some rule.

In Test Example, the input is more extensive with multiple branches, so perhaps each branch's subtree is being processed independently, applying these transformations to reach the final output.

I need to figure out if there's an operation that can take the root value from 0 to 9, which might involve adding layers or increasing depth. Similarly, for other parameters like width and height of subtrees, they seem to be incrementing each time by a certain factor.

Another thought is that these transformations could be related to matrix operations or convolutional layers in neural networks, considering the dimensions (like 14x14 matrices), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Perhaps it's simpler: for each node, based on its type (0 or 1) and position, zeros are being appended or certain values are shifted. For example, nodes with value 1 might have their lists of children modified by appending new elements filled with zeros or ones in a specific pattern.

Looking at the output from Test Example:
- The main root becomes 9 instead of something else.
- There's a subtree with (25 (1,0) (16x16) ...). So again, similar structure but increased parameters.

I'm starting to think that each time a node has children, new child nodes are added based on some rule. For instance, every 9th node might spawn multiple zeros or ones in its place.

Alternatively, it could be about the number of nodes: the main root goes from 0 to 9 after processing all the subtrees. Each subtree contributes incrementally to this final value, perhaps by adding their own numbers and then combining them somehow.

Wait, looking at Train Example 4:
Input tree has a right subtree with (1x5) structure leading to 1 [[1]], and output is modified accordingly.

Perhaps each node's influence on the main root is additive based on its depth or position. So nodes higher up contribute more, while deeper ones contribute less, maybe multiplied by some factor related to their depth.

Another angle: considering that all input trees have certain patterns in their lists of children (like [[0,0,0,0,0]] for 1x5), these could be vectors or one-hot encodings. Maybe during processing, these are transformed into larger matrices with specific values appended or transposed.

Wait, looking at the first example:

Input Tree:
(0 (0,0) (1x5) 0 [[0,0,0,0,0]] ... )

Output Tree has a main root of 9. Then another subtree which is also modified to have dimensions increasing from 14x14 to 16x16.

So perhaps each node's processing involves taking its current value and adding new elements based on the number of children or something similar.

Alternatively, it might be about replacing the list [[0,0,...]] with a larger matrix by appending rows or columns filled with zeros. For example, converting a 5-element vector into a 16x16 matrix by padding.

Another observation: in Train Example 3's output, there are two main subtrees connected to the root (9 and 25). The sum of their roots is 9 +25=34? But I don't see that number in the input. Alternatively, maybe they're contributing to a final value through some operation.

Wait, looking at Test Example's output: it has two main subtrees with roots 16 and 20. Summing those gives 36. The main root is 9? Hmm, not sure how that connects.

Alternatively, the numbers in the main root (like 9 or 16) might be related to their position or depth. For example, each level's nodes have roots equal to some function of their depth.

But without more examples, it's challenging to deduce the exact rule.

Perhaps a better approach is to see if there's a consistent mathematical operation applied across all transformations. Let's take specific parts:

In Train Example 3:
- The initial subtree (9 ...) has parameters that might be derived from the previous one.
- Input: 14x14 matrix, output becomes 16x16.

Similarly, Test Example input for a subtree is 5 elements long, maybe transformed into another structure.

Alternatively, each time you move down a level, you add some padding or zeros. For example, a node at depth d has its children filled with a certain number of zero vectors based on d.

Wait, looking back:

Input tree in Train Example 3:
- Root:0
- Left child: (0,0)
- Right subtree:9...

Output root becomes 9 instead of something else. So the processing is likely to transform parts of the input into different parameters that contribute to a final result.

Perhaps each node's value and its children influence the main tree's root through some additive or multiplicative process.

Alternatively, maybe these are layers in a neural network where each layer transforms the input by adding new neurons (children) with certain activation values. For example, zero-initializing new neurons when they're added as children.

Wait, looking at how the child lists change:

In Train Example 3's output:
- The main root is 9.
- One of its subtrees has a list of [0]... filled with zeros and maybe another structure appended.

Alternatively, for each node in the subtree, when it spawns new children (i.e., when it appends to its child list), these are filled with certain patterns like 1s or 0s.

Another thought: The main root might be computed by summing all the non-zero elements across all nodes. In Test Example:

- Root is 9.
- Subtree roots:25, which would imply that if we have to reach 9 somehow, maybe through subtraction? But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each node contributes a value based on its type (0 or1) and depth, then the main root sums these contributions. For example:

Nodes with value 1 might contribute their own count multiplied by some factor.

But without knowing how exactly the transformation is done, it's tricky to be precise.

Maybe I should think of this as a tree processing problem where each node has certain attributes that are manipulated based on their position or value, and these manipulations propagate through the tree until reaching the root.

Perhaps nodes at even depths contribute differently than those at odd depths. Or maybe nodes with 1s have different transformations compared to 0s.

Another possibility is that when a subtree is processed, it's expanded by appending zeros around its matrix structure, effectively increasing its size. For example, padding a 14x14 matrix with two rows and columns of zeros on each side, turning it into 16x16.

Similarly, the input's [[0,0,0,0,0]] could be transformed by adding elements to make it larger in both dimensions.

But I'm not entirely sure how exactly this transformation is happening. It might require looking at more examples or trying to reverse-engineer the process from given inputs and outputs.

In summary, based on the information provided:

1. The main root's value increases from 0 to a higher number after processing.
2. Subtrees undergo transformations that change their dimensions (e.g., from 14x14 to 16x16).
3. Each node might contribute certain values or structures that are combined to form the final output.

Without more data points, it's challenging to determine the exact transformation rules, but these observations give a starting point for further analysis.

It seems like you're describing a tree structure where each node undergoes specific transformations based on its position and attributes. The main root value increases from 0 to a higher number after processing, while subtrees are transformed by changing their dimensions or padding with zeros.

If you provide more examples or clarify the exact transformation rules, I can help further!
