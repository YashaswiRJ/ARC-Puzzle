Answer

To analyze the relationship between the input and output trees, let's break down the transformation rules observed in the provided examples:
Transformation Rules:

    Parent-Child Relationship:

        Each child node in the input tree becomes a parent node in the output tree.

        A new child is added to each of these nodes in the output tree.

    New Child Node Properties:

        Color: The new child node always has color '4' (cyan).

        Shape: The shape of the new child is always a rectangle.

        Dimensions: The dimensions of the new child are derived based on a reduction of its parent's dimensions:

            Width is reduced by 2 (parent width - 2).

            Height is reduced by 2 (parent height - 2).

        If the resulting dimensions are less than or equal to zero, no child is added.

    Positioning:

        The top-left cell of the new child node is offset from its parent's top-left cell:

            Row offset: +1 (parent's top-left row + 1).

            Column offset: +1 (parent's top-left column + 1).

    Infix Notation:

        The infix notation reflects the new hierarchy, with each original child now having its own child.

Predicted Output for Test Input Tree
Input Tree Details:

    Root has 4 children: A, B, C, D.

    Canvas size: 14x13.

    Child nodes:

        Node A: Color '1', Dimensions 6x6, Top-left (5, 3).

        Node B: Color '2', Dimensions 3x3, Top-left (1, 8).

        Node C: Color '2', Dimensions 4x5, Top-left (0, 1).

        Node D: Color '3', Dimensions 7x4, Top-left (7, 9).

Output Tree Details:

    Node A:

        Becomes a parent in the output tree.

        New child:

            Color: '4' (cyan).

            Dimensions: 6x6 → (6-2)x(6-2) = 4x4.

            Top-left cell: (5+1, 3+1) = (6, 4).

    Node B:

        Becomes a parent in the output tree.

        New child:

            Color: '4' (cyan).

            Dimensions: 3x3 → (3-2)x(3-2) = 1x1.

            Top-left cell: (1+1, 8+1) = (2, 9).

    Node C:

        Becomes a parent in the output tree.

        New child:

            Color: '4' (cyan).

            Dimensions: 4x5 → (4-2)x(5-2) = 2x3.

            Top-left cell: (0+1, 1+1) = (1, 2).

    Node D:

        Becomes a parent in the output tree.

        New child:

            Color: '4' (cyan).

            Dimensions: 7x4 → (7-2)x(4-2) = 5x2.

            Top-left cell: (7+1, 9+1) = (8, 10).

Output Infix Notation:

Details of Children for A, B, C, D:

    Node A:

        Child: E

            Color: '4' (cyan)

            Shape: Rectangle

            Dimensions: 4x4

            Top-left cell: (6, 4)

    Node B:

        Child: F

            Color: '4' (cyan)

            Shape: Rectangle

            Dimensions: 1x1

            Top-left cell: (2, 9)

    Node C:

        Child: G

            Color: '4' (cyan)

            Shape: Rectangle

            Dimensions: 2x3

            Top-left cell: (1, 2)

    Node D:

        Child: H

            Color: '4' (cyan)

            Shape: Rectangle

            Dimensions: 5x2

            Top-left cell: (8, 10)

Final Output:

The predicted output tree is as follows:

Infix Notation:

Root(A(E), B(F), C(G), D(H))

Canvas Structure Details:

    Node A → Child E (Color '4', Dimensions '4x4', Top-left '(6, 4)')

    Node B → Child F (Color '4', Dimensions '1x1', Top-left '(2, 9)')

    Node C → Child G (Color '4', Dimensions '2x3', Top-left '(1, 2)')

    Node D → Child H (Color '4', Dimensions '5x2', Top-left '(8, 10)')
