["User: Hey Deepseek, I'm sharing you the one way of constructing tree (In graph theory, computer science) using infix notation of nodes.\n\nFor example, 1(2(3,4,5),6): represents a tree whose root node is 1 which have two child 2 and 6, 2 has three child 3,4,5 and 6 has no child.\n\nAnother example 3(2,8(1,9)): Here root node is 3, and it has 2 child 2 and 8, 2 has no child whereas 8 has two child 1 and 9.\n\nNow, I'm providing the details of the input-output tree structure along with images, and I would like you to analyze the transformation rule that converts the input matrix into the output matrix.\n\nInput 1:\n\nCanvas Details:\n- Canvas background color: '0' (black)\n- Canvas size: 12x11\n- Root Node (Root):\n  - Color: black\n  - Size: 12x11\n  - Number of children: 2\n  - Children: A, B\n\nChild Nodes (A, B):\n1.

Let me start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the first test case: there's a root node A which has four children (B, C, D). The Infix Notation is Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). So it seems like each child of the root gets processed individually. Each parent node processes its own set of nodes based on their colors.\n\nIn the first input tree, node A was colored '1' and had a child E with color '2'. Node B was '2' and had no children in that case? Wait, looking back, node B didn't have any children because it's specified as having none. But then in the output for test 3, when input is Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), each of A, B, C gets their own child E, F, G respectively.\n\nWait a minute, actually, no: looking at the first example:\n\nInfix Notation was Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). The output tree had nodes with children E, F, etc. So for input 3, where the root has A, B, C, D, and each of them is processed separately.\n\nLooking at test case 1: Input has a root with node A(D). Infix notation Root(A(D)) produces an Output with A having child E. So it seems that when you have a node in the infix list (like A(D)), you process its own children.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nIn test case 1:\n- Input: Root(A(D), B(E), C(F))\nSo each of A, B, C has their own child: D is a child of A? Or wait, the notation might mean that node A's right subtree is D, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to parse this as an infix traversal where you process left, then root, then right.\n\nBut looking at test case 3:\n\nInput Infix Notation: Root(A, B, C, D)\nOutput has each of these nodes processed into A(E), B(F), etc., meaning that for each parent node (A,B,C,D) in the infix list, a new child is added with their respective color.\n\nWait no, maybe it's not about adding children but about applying some transformation to each node. Let me see:\n\nIn test case 1:\nInput: Node A has D as its child, and when processed, it becomes A(E), where E is cyan (color '4'). Similarly, B had a blue child with color '2', which was transformed into F with cyan.\n\nWait no, perhaps each node's children are being colored based on some rules. Let me check the previous examples:\n\nIn test case 1:\n- Node A has D as a child and in output becomes E (cyan). So maybe when processing a node, you add a new child whose color is determined by some rule.\n\nWait no, perhaps it's about adding children of certain colors based on parent's color. For example, if the parent is '1' (red), then its child is cyan ('4'), and so on.\n\nLooking at test case 3:\n\nInput root nodes A, B, C, D with colors '1', '2', '2', '3'.\n\nIn output:\n- Node A's child E has color '2'.\nWait no: in the input tree, node A was red (color '1'), and in output it became a child with cyan ('4'). Similarly, nodes B and C were blue ('2') and had children F and G as cyan. Node D was green ('3') and had a cyan child.\n\nSo perhaps when processing each root node, we add a new child whose color is determined by some function of the parent's color.\n\nWait, in test case 1:\n- Input: A has color '1' (red) and has a child D. In output, it becomes E with color '2'.\n\nIn test case 3:\n- Node A: color '1' \u2192 child cyan ('4').\n- Nodes B and C: color '2' \u2192 children cyan.\n- Node D: color '3' \u2192 child cyan.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that any node's color determines whether it gets a new child, but for nodes with certain colors (like blue), they get a new child of cyan. Red also gets a child of cyan? Or wait, no:\n\nIn test case 1:\n- Node A: '1' \u2192 becomes E ('2'), which is cyan.\nWait, perhaps the color transitions are as follows: red \u2192 cyan, blue \u2192 cyan, green \u2192 cyan.\n\nBut looking at another example in test case 3, node B had a child F of cyan (color '4'). So that's consistent. Similarly, C's child G is cyan. D's child H is cyan.\n\nWait, but how about the parent nodes? Node A was red and its child became cyan; B was blue \u2192 cyan; C was green \u2192 cyan; D was cyan\u2192 I'm not sure what happens.\n\nSo perhaps any node that isn't cyan would have a child added based on their color. For example:\n\n- If parent is red, add cyan.\n- If blue, add cyan.\n- If green, add cyan.\nBut the root nodes in test case 3 were red (A), blue (B and C), and green (D). So they all had children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps regardless of the color, each node adds a child based on some default rule. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn test case 1:\n- Node A: '1' \u2192 E ('2')\nWait no, in output it was cyan. So maybe the function is that when processing a node, if its color isn't cyan, you add a new cyan child.\n\nBut wait, let's see another example to check:\n\nIf we had an input where a root node is cyan, would it have children? Or does it not?\n\nSince there are no examples given for this case, perhaps in the context of test cases provided, all roots except maybe the last were non-cyan. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that each node's color determines whether and how many children they get.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the question: It says \"the Infix Notation\" as an example, which might be referring to a specific way of processing nodes in order, applying some function on their children.\n\nWait, maybe it's about creating a mirror image or reversing the list. For instance:\n\nIn test case 1:\n- Input: A(D), B(E), C(F)\nOutput seems to have each node with an additional cyan child. So perhaps for every node in the infix list (except maybe the last one?), we add a new cyan-colored node as its right sibling.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about processing nodes and appending children based on certain color rules.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at test case 3:\n\nInput Infix Notation Root(A, B, C, D) where A is '1', B and C are '2', D is '3'\n\nOutput is:\nRoot with four subtrees: each of these nodes (A,B,C,D) has a cyan child.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that for every node in the input Infix list, we add a new cyan child to it. So regardless of the parent's color or position, we append a cyan-colored node as its rightmost child.\n\nAlternatively, if you have multiple nodes after A, then only process each node one by one and apply transformations.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be precise. However, based on test case 3:\n\nEach input root (A,B,C,D) is processed into a new subtree where they have a cyan child. So perhaps the rule is: for any root in the Infix list, add a cyan-colored node as its rightmost child.\n\nIf that's the case, then for an input with multiple roots, each would get their own cyan child added to them.\n\nSo applying this rule to test case 1:\n\nInput:\nRoot(A(D), B(E), C(F)) \u2192 Output: Root(A(E, D?), ... )\n\nWait no. Let me look again at test case 1's output Infix Notation:\n\nIt was Root(A(D), E, F). Wait, perhaps it's that for each root in the infix list (A,B,C,D), we add a new cyan child.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because the notation is unclear to me. Maybe focusing on the color transitions will help.\n\nLooking at test case 3:\n\nRoot nodes: A('1'), B('2'), C('2'), D('3') \u2192 each in output has a cyan ('4') child.\n\nSo perhaps, for any root node (in infix list), we add a new child of cyan. So the number of roots is preserved, but each gets an additional cyan child.\n\nBut then in test case 1:\n\nRoots: A(B), B(C), C(D) \u2192 Output seems to have more nodes?\n\nWait no, looking back, perhaps it's better to note that in all previous examples, for each root node processed (A,B,C,D etc.), a new cyan-colored node is added as its rightmost child.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the number or colors of parent roots, every root gets an additional cyan child appended after them.\n\nThus, applying this rule:\n\nIf I have test case 1 with input Infix Notation Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), then each A,B,C would get their own cyan children. So output would be four nodes: A with D and E (cyan?), B with E and F, etc.\n\nWait no, perhaps it's about adding a single cyan child per root in the infix list.\n\nSo for test case 1, input has three roots: A,B,C \u2192 each gets a cyan child added to them. So output would have four nodes, each having their own set plus a cyan node.\n\nBut this is speculative without more examples.\n\nIn conclusion, based on given test cases:\n\n- Each root in the infix list (in order) will have an additional cyan ('4') child.\n- The number of roots remains the same as the input.\n- Thus, for any Infix notation with multiple roots, each gets one cyan node added after them.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to transform a given Infix Notation tree by adding a specific type of node (cyan) as a right sibling to each root node in the tree. The transformation involves appending a cyan node ('4') immediately after each root node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given an Infix Notation tree and need to transform it such that every root node gets a cyan node added as its immediate right child.\n2. **Transform Each Root Node**: For each root node found in the input, append a new node with value '4' (cyan) after it.\n3. **Construct the Output**: Traverse the Infix tree recursively and apply the transformation to each root node.\n\n### Solution Code\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class TreeNode {\n    char value;\n    List<TreeNode> children;\n\n    public TreeNode(char value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        this.children = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addChild(char value, TreeNode child) {\n        this.children.add(new TreeNode(child));\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public static TreeNode[] transformInfixNotation(TreeNode root) {\n        List<TreeNode> childrenList = new ArrayList<>();\n        // Add a cyan child to the current node\n        if (root != null) {\n            root.addChild('4', new TreeNode('4'));\n        }\n        \n        for (TreeNode child : root.children) {\n            childrenList.add(transformInfixNotation(child));\n        }\n        \n        return childrenList.toArray(new TreeNode[0]);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        TreeNode root = new TreeNode('A');\n        root.addChild('B', new TreeNode('B'));\n        root.addChild('C', new TreeNode('C'));\n        \n        // Expected output: Each of A, B, C has a cyan child added.\n        // So after transformation:\n        // Root becomes A with children ['B', '4'], then each subsequent node is processed similarly.\n        TreeNode[] transformed = transformInfixNotation(root);\n        for (TreeNode t : transformed) {\n            System.out.println(t.value + \": \" + t.children.size());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **TreeNode Class**: Represents a node in the tree, with a value and a list of children.\n- **transformInfixNotation Method**: Recursively traverses each node. For every non-null root node encountered, it adds a cyan ('4') node as its immediate right child.\n- **Main Method**: Constructs an example tree and demonstrates how to transform it by printing the transformed tree structure.\n\nThis approach ensures that each root node in the input Infix Notation tree gets exactly one cyan node appended after it, resulting in the desired transformation."]
