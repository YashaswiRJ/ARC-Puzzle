My task is to figure out what transformation rule turns the inputs into outputs.\n\nLet me start by looking at each pair one by one.\n\nFirst, Input 1:\n111\n000\n000\nAnd Output 1 is:\n000\n111\n000\n\nSo, it looks like the first row of Input 1 has all 1s, and in Output 1, that becomes the second row with three 1s. The other rows go from all 0s to a single 0 at the bottom left corner.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: Input 1's output is:\n\nRow 1: 000\nRow 2: 111\nRow 3: 000\n\nSo the entire first row becomes zeros and the middle row turns into all 1s. The third row also goes to zero.\n\nHmm, maybe it's moving the value from one position to another? Let me check other inputs.\n\nInput 2:\n000\n111\n000\nOutput 2 is:\n000\n000\n111\n\nSo here, Input 2 has a middle row of all 1s. The Output 2 changes it so the third row is all 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is moving all non-zero values from one position to another based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at Input 3:\n010\n110\n000\n\nOutput 3 is:\n000\n010\n110\n\nSo in Input 3, row 2 has 1s starting from column 2. The Output moves this to the third row, same columns.\n\nInput 4:\n022\n002\n000\n\nOutput 4:\n000\n022\n002\n\nHere, the first two rows have some non-zero values, and in Output 4, they're shifted down. So Input's first row (which had 0,2,2) becomes Input's third row in Output.\n\nWait, maybe it's a rotation or shift of the matrix? Let me see:\n\nInput 1: The top row is all 1s; Output has that as the middle row.\nInput 2: Middle row is all 1s; Output moves to bottom.\nInput 3: Middle-left column in Input becomes lower-middle in Output.\nWait, maybe it's a cyclic shift down?\n\nBut looking at Input 4 again:\nOriginal matrix (Rows):\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow1: 0,0,0\nRow2: 0,2,2\nRow3: 0,0,2\n\nSo it seems like the first row of Input moves to the third row, and the second row moves to the first? Or maybe a rotation.\n\nWait, perhaps each column is shifted down by one. Let's see:\n\nIn Input 1:\nFirst column (leftmost) in all rows is: 1,0,0 \u2192 Output becomes 0,1,0.\nSecond column: same as others are zeros except top left?\nWait, maybe it's moving the non-zero values from each row down by one.\n\nBut let me check for Input 3:\n\nInput:\nRow2 (second row) has two 1s. In Output, these become Row3. So seems like they moved down by one.\n\nIn Input4:\nFirst row: [0,2,2]\nSecond row: [0,0,2]\nSo the non-zero values in first row are at columns 2 and 3; second row has only column 3.\nIn Output4, these shift down so that second row becomes third row, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's moving each non-zero value one row down, wrapping around. So top row goes to middle or bottom?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is rotating all rows down by two steps. Let me see:\n\nFor Input1:\nOriginal Rows (Top to Bottom):\nRow1: 1,1,1\nRow2: 0,0,0\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nIf we rotate each row down once, Row1 would become Row2, Row2 becomes Row3, and Row3 wraps around to Row1. But that doesn't match Output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a single right shift for the non-zero elements in each row.\n\nWait, looking at Input 4:\nRow1: [0,2,2]\nIf we move these down once, they would go to Row2 and then wrap around to Row3? So Row1 becomes Row2 as 0,2,2. Then Row2's values (0,0,2) become Row3. Wait, but in Output4, the second row is [0,2,2], which matches Row1 of Input moving down once.\n\nWait that might fit:\n\nIf for each column, we take its value from the previous row and place it below? Or perhaps it's a vertical shift where all rows move down by one, with the top row wrapping to the bottom.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis.\n\nFor Input 4:\nOriginal Rows (Top to Bottom):\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nShifting each row down by one would make Row1 become Row2, Row2 becomes Row3, and Row3 wraps around to Row1.\n\nBut in Output4:\nRow1 is 0,0,0 (which was Row3 original)\nRow2 is 0,2,2 (which was Row1 original shifted down once)\nRow3 is 0,0,2 (which was Row2 original)\n\nSo that seems consistent. Let me check for Input1.\n\nInput1 Rows:\nRow1: 1,1,1\nRow2: 0,0,0\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nShifting down by one:\n\nRow1 becomes Row2 (all zeros)\nRow2 becomes Row3 (all zeros)\nRow3 wraps to Row1 with its original values? No, because in Output1, Row1 is all zeros. So maybe the shift isn't exactly that.\n\nWait, no. If we rotate each row as a whole down once, then:\n\nInput1 Rows after shifting:\nRow1: 0 (from Row2)\nRow2: 0 (from Row3)\nRow3: [1,1,1] from Row1\n\nBut Output1 is:\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2: 1s\nRow3: 0\n\nSo that would match. So each row's values shift down by one, with the last element wrapping to the top.\n\nWait no, because in Input4, the first column was [0,0,0], but after shifting, it becomes:\n\nIn Output4:\nRow1 has 0 (from Row3)\nRow2 has 0 and then 0 shifted from where? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero value in a row is moved down by one position. So any number in a row is copied to the next row below, with wrap-around for the last row.\n\nLet me test this with Input4:\n\nRow1: 0,2,2\nShifting each element down once:\n- The first element of Row1 (0) goes to Row2 as 0.\nWait no, but in Output4, Row2 becomes [0,2,2], which was Row1.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a single shift for the entire matrix. Maybe shifting rows down by one, with the top row moving to the bottom.\n\nIn Input4:\nOriginal Rows:\n\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nShifting each row down once (so Row1 becomes Row2's original values, etc.), but that doesn't fit Output because in Output4, Row2 is [0,2,2], which was Row1.\n\nWait, so perhaps it's a vertical shift where the rows are rotated downward. So the top row moves to middle, middle to bottom, and bottom wraps around? Or maybe each row is shifted down by one step with wrap-around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all elements in the matrix are moved down by two steps, making the first row go to third.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor Input1:\nRow1: 1,1,1 \u2192 after moving down twice (which would be same as up once), becomes Row3. But Output1 has Row2 filled with 1s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to find a pattern by looking at the non-zero positions in each input and their corresponding output.\n\nInput1: Non-zeros are all in Row1. Output1 moves these to Row2.\n\nInput2: Non-zeros are all in Row2 \u2192 Output has them in Row3.\n\nInput3: Non-zeros are in Row2, columns 1-2 \u2192 Output is Row3's same columns.\n\nWait no, Input3:\n\nOriginal:\nRow1: ?\nRow2: [0, something]\nWait, maybe I should write each input and output clearly.\n\nLet me define the matrices as per the user's description. Assume that the matrix has three rows (as examples have 3x? dimensions).\n\nAssuming all are 3-row matrices with varying columns or filled with zeros.\n\nInput1:\nRow1: [1,1,1]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput1:\nRow1: [0,0,0]\nRow2: [1,1,1]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nSo it's as if the top row (Row1) has moved down to Row2.\n\nSimilarly, Input2:\n\nInput2 likely is something like:\n\nRow1: all zeros\nRow2: all non-zeros\nRow3: all zeros\n\nOutput would move these to Row3. But in Output 2, assuming it's similar to the pattern, Row3 becomes filled with the same values as Row2.\n\nWait no, if Input2 has its non-zero elements in Row2, then Output2 should have them in Row3, which is what we see for Input1 and Input3.\n\nSo perhaps this is a cyclic shift: each row's content shifts down by one, wrapping around. So the top row goes to middle, middle to bottom, bottom wraps to top.\n\nWait let me test that with Input4:\n\nInput4:\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nShifting each row down by one (with wrap-around):\n\nNew Row1 would be Row2's original values \u2192 [0,0,2]\nBut in Output4, Row1 is [0,0,0], which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's shifting up.\n\nWait perhaps the shift direction is different. Maybe each row shifts up by one, with bottom wrapping to top.\n\nSo:\n\nInput1 shifted up once:\nRow1: becomes Row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nWhich matches Output1.\n\nSimilarly, Input2 (assuming non-zeros in Row2) would be shifted to Row3.\n\nWait let's check for the third example. The user didn't provide a clear third input-output pair, but let's assume similar logic applies.\n\nIf that's the case, then shifting each row up by one step wraps the bottom to top. So the first element of each column moves up once, with the last becoming the first.\n\nSo in Input4:\n\nOriginal Rows:\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nAfter shifting up by one (each row's elements move up, and the top moves to bottom):\n\nNew Row1 would take from original Row3 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow2 takes from original Row1 \u2192 [0,2,2]\nRow3 takes from original Row2 \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches Output4:\nRow1: 0,0,0\nRow2: 0,2,2\nRow3: 0,0,2\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the pattern is a vertical cyclic shift upwards for each row, meaning each element moves up one position per column, and the first elements of each column wrap around to the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule seems to be:\n\nEach value in a given row's column moves up by one row (with the top value moving to the bottom), so that each non-zero \"appears\" shifted upwards once. But actually, it might not affect individual values but shifts their rows such that all elements are moved down by one.\n\nWait wait no, because if shifting up is happening, then it's more like when you shift up, the row above moves to the top.\n\nSo perhaps for each column, moving all non-zero elements up once. But in terms of matrix transformation, this would require that rows are rotated upward.\n\nYes, so every time we perform a cyclic shift upwards on the entire matrix (each element moves up one row), with the first row's elements wrapping around to the last position. This effectively causes each element in the original Row1 to move into Row3 if it was 3-row matrix, but more generally for any n rows.\n\nWait no, because shifting up once would mean that all rows are rotated so that the top row becomes the second, the second becomes third, and the bottom wraps around. So in a 3-row matrix:\n\nOriginal:\nRow1: A\nRow2: B\nRow3: C\n\nAfter shift up by one (each element moves to previous row):\n\nNew Row1 is original Row3 \u2192 C\nNew Row2 is original Row1 \u2192 A\nNew Row3 is original Row2 \u2192 B\n\nWait that's a different kind of rotation. So in this case, the matrix has been shifted upward once.\n\nBut for each column, every value shifts up one row; if you have an N-row matrix, after shifting, each element (except those in first position) are moved to the row above, and elements from top move to bottom.\n\nWait no, I think perhaps it's better to consider that when we shift each row up by one, with wrap-around. So:\n\nOriginal Rows:\nRow1: a b c\nRow2: d e f\nRow3: g h i\n\nShift up once (so each element moves to the previous row; first elements go to last row):\n\nNew Row1 will be Row2's original values \u2192 d e f\nRow2 becomes Row3 \u2192 g h i\nRow3 becomes Row1 \u2192 a b c\n\nBut in Output4, after shifting:\n\nOriginal Input4:\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nAfter shift up once (each element moves to previous row; first elements wrap around):\n\nRow1 becomes Row2's values \u2192 [0,0,2]\nRow2 becomes Row3's values \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow3 becomes Row1's values \u2192 [0,2,2]\n\nBut in Output4:\nRow1: 0,0,0\nRow2: 0,2,2\nRow3: 0,0,2\n\nWhich is different from what I just computed. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the shift direction was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is shifted down once (so elements move to next row; bottom wraps around). So:\n\nOriginal Rows:\nRow1: a b c\nRow2: d e f\nRow3: g h i\n\nShift down once:\n\nNew Row1 = original Row2 \u2192 d e f\nNew Row2 = original Row3 \u2192 g h i\nNew Row3 = original Row1 \u2192 a b c\n\nBut for the given Output4, if Input was:\nInput4 Rows before shift:\nRow1: 0,2,2\nRow2: 0,0,2\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nAfter shifting down once:\n\nNew Row1 would be [0,0,2]\nNew Row2 is [0,0,0]\nNew Row3 is [0,2,2]\n\nWhich matches Output4:\nRow1: 0,0,2 \u2192 Wait no.\n\nWait in Output4's first row (from user) is [0,0,0], second [0,2,2], third [0,0,2].\n\nSo that doesn't match a shift down. Alternatively, maybe it was shifted up twice? Or some other way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire matrix is rotated in such a way that each element's row increases by 1 modulo the number of rows. So for example:\n\nEach element (i,j) becomes (i+1 mod N, j).\n\nBut if we have three rows, then shifting once would mean Row0 moves to Row1, Row1 \u2192 Row2, Row2\u2192Row0.\n\nWait but in that case:\n\nOriginal:\nRow0: a b c\nRow1: d e f\nRow2: g h i\n\nAfter one shift (each row shifted up):\n\nNew Row0 is original Row2 \u2192 g h i\nRow1 = original Row0 \u2192 a b c\nRow2= original Row1 \u2192 d e f\n\nSo the rows are rotated in that way.\n\nBut according to Output4, after transformation:\n\nRow1 of Input4 becomes Row2.\n\nWait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: for each column, non-zero elements \"appear\" shifted once up. So if a value was originally at (i,j), now it's at ((i-1) mod N, j).\n\nSo in the first case:\n\nInput1:\nRow0: 1 1 1\nRow1: 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0\n\nAfter shift up once for each column:\n\nRow0 becomes Row1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow1 becomes Row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow2 becomes Row0 (original) shifted up would be Row-1 which wraps to Row2. Wait maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are moved up by one row; so all values in each column move from row i to i+1 mod N.\n\nIn Input4:\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0:0\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\n\nAfter shifting up once (each element moves up, wrapping), new Row0 would have the last element of Column0 \u2192 which was Row2's value; but in this case, all were zero. So no change.\n\nBut Output4 shows that Row3 has [0,0,2], etc., so perhaps it's shifted down? Maybe for each column, the entire column is shifted up by one row, with the top element wrapping to bottom.\n\nSo:\n\nFor Input1:\nOriginal Column 0: [1,0,0]\n\nShift up once \u2192 new order: [0,0,1].\n\nWait in Output1 (the first transformation example given), they had an initial state where Row2 is [something], and after shifting became like that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rotation of the entire matrix. For instance, each row is shifted to the right once; but no, considering the columns' structure.\n\nWait another angle: looking at Output4:\n\nAfter transformation, in column 0:\nRow1 has 2 (from Input was Row3)\nColumn 1:\nIn Input, Column 1 had 2 in Row3. After transform, it's now at Row2.\nSimilarly for other values.\n\nThis suggests that each element is moving up once; so original position i becomes new position j = (i+1) mod N.\n\nWait no: because if you have three rows, and elements shift up by one, then the value from row0 moves to row1, row1\u2192row2, row2\u2192row0? No, perhaps a cycle where each element is moved up once in its column. So for example:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\nRow 0 | Column A\nRow 1 \nRow 2 \n\nAfter shifting all columns down by one (each value moves to the next row below; bottom wraps to top):\n\nNew Row0 becomes original Row2's values.\nNew Row1: Row0.\nNew Row2: Row1.\n\nBut in Output4, the transformed matrix is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nLooking at Input4:\nOriginal Rows (assuming 3 rows):\nRow0: [0,2,2]\nRow1: [0,0,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation:\n\nRow0 becomes Row2's original values \u2192 but Output4's Row0 is all zeros.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it was a rotation of each column down once.\n\nFor example:\nTake a single column:\n\nOriginal: a (row0), b (row1), c (row2)\n\nShifted up once in the column would become:\n\nRow0: c\nRow1: a\nRow2: b\n\nWait that's if you rotate the column upwards. So each element moves up, with the top wrapping to bottom.\n\nSo for Input4's first column:\nOriginal values:\nRow0: 0 (assuming input is [0; row0], then in this case perhaps no):\n\nWait I'm getting confused because without knowing the exact structure of Inputs and Outputs beyond Output4, it's hard to deduce exactly how the transformation works.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the problem statement again. The user says \"these were your thoughts\" but that seems like a placeholder for their own thought process, not actual input from them. Wait no: actually, in the first line, they said \"These were your thoughts on how to approach this problem...\", so perhaps it's an internal dialogue.\n\nSo maybe I can reconstruct based on possible transformations:\n\nLooking at Output4, the transformed matrix is as follows:\nRow0: 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 2 2\nRow2: 0 0 2\n\nOriginal Input4 was likely:\nRow0: 0 2 2\nRow1: 0 0 2\nRow2: 0 0 0\n\nSo comparing each row:\n\nRow0 in Output is all zeros, but Row0 in Input had [0,2,2]. So perhaps the non-zero elements are moved up by one.\n\nIn column 1 and 2 of Row1 in Input was [2,2], which in Output4's Row1 is [2,2].\n\nWait maybe that's not shifting. Alternatively, looking at each column:\n\nColumn0:\nInput: Row0=0, Row1=0, Row2=0 \u2192 after transform remains same.\n\nBut for Column1 and 2:\n\nIn Input, Column1 was Row0:2, Row1:0, Row2:0\n\nAfter transform in Output4's Row1 is [2,2]. Wait no. Alternatively, maybe each value moves down once?\n\nWait this approach may not be working as I can't fully reconstruct the transformation without knowing more examples.\n\nPerhaps another way: looking at the problem statement, it seems that in Output4, after some transformations (maybe multiple steps), the result is:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 2 2\nRow2: 0 0 2\n\nSo perhaps each column has its values shifted up once. So for example, if we have three rows, and a value in Row i moves to (i+1) mod 3.\n\nBut when applying this:\n\nTake Column2 of Input4:\nInput was [2 (Row0), 2 (Row1?), wait no: original input is perhaps as I thought before?\n\nWait maybe the transformation is each column shifted up by one, wrapping around. So in that case:\n\nOriginal Row0 becomes new Row3? No.\n\nAlternatively, considering that shifting a row down would make the values move to lower rows, with the bottom value moving to top.\n\nFor example:\nShifting each column down once means:\n\nRow0 (original) \u2192 Row1\nRow1 \u2192 Row2\nRow2 \u2192 Row0\n\nSo in Output4's Column1 and 2 had their non-zero elements at Row1 and Row2, which were previously at higher rows. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is each column shifted right once or left? Not likely because it affects columns.\n\nWait another approach: considering that in some of the outputs, certain values appear only in specific positions based on their original location. For instance, if a value moves from row i to row j based on its position.\n\nMaybe the key is to find out how each cell's value relates before and after transformation. Let's think about Output4:\n\nOutput4:\nRow0: [0 0 0]\nRow1: [0 2 2]\nRow2: [0 0 2]\n\nComparing this to Input4, which I assume was the previous state (like the third output):\n\nIn Output3, perhaps it's something else.\n\nBut given that I can't see the exact Inputs and Outputs beyond what's in the problem statement, maybe an alternative is needed.\n\nAlternatively, think of a simple transformation: each row is reversed or shifted. But without more context, this is tricky.\n\nWait, stepping back, perhaps the question involves matrix transformations where each column is rotated left or right. For example, shifting each column to the right once would move the last element to the first position in that column.\n\nBut given Output4's structure:\n\nIn column 1 and 2 of Row1 are both 2s. If Input4 had those columns as [0,2,2], then perhaps shifted down twice? Or rotated?\n\nWait maybe this is a cyclic shift where each column is rotated up or down by one.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be similar to rotation layers in matrices: rotating each ring of the matrix in some direction.\n\nBut without knowing more about the problem's context (like previous steps or transformations), it's difficult to deduce exactly what happens here.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, perhaps an alternative approach is needed. Maybe think about code that performs such transformations.\n\nIf I have to write a Python function for cyclic shifts on matrices, how would it look?\n\nFor example, if the transformation is a right shift of each row:\n\ndef cyclic_shift_right(matrix):\n    shifted = []\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    for c in range(cols):\n        new_row = [matrix[r][c] for r in reversed(range(rows))]\n        shifted.append(new_row)\n    return shifted\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, a cyclic shift of each column:\n\ndef cyclic_shift_columns(matrix, shift):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    for c in range(cols):\n        # extract column\n        col = [matrix[r][c] for r in range(rows)]\n        # perform cyclic shift\n        rotated_col = rotate(col, shift)\n        # reconstruct matrix\n        new_matrix = []\n        for r in range(rows):\n            new_row = [0]*cols\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if (r - (shift)) % rows == 0:\n                    new_row[c] = col[r]\n                else:\n                    new_row[c] = 0\n            new_matrix.append(new_row)\n    return new_matrix\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is a rotation of each column by one position down. So for example, shifting each column up once would mean that row 0 gets row1's value and so on.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what transformations were applied in Output4, it's challenging to code correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is such that each cell (i,j) moves to (j,i), a transpose. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, perhaps I should look for another approach or try to see if any patterns emerge when considering possible shift directions.\n\nBut since time is limited and my knowledge is limited without more context, maybe the answer lies in recognizing that each column has been shifted down by one row.\n\nSo in code terms:\n\nIf we have a matrix with m rows and n columns, then shifting each column down once would make row i's element go to (i+1) mod m. So for example:\n\nmatrix = [\n    [a, b],\n    [c, d]\n]\n\nshifted matrix after down shift:\n[\n    [c, d],\n    [a, b]\n]\n\nSo the code could be as follows.\n\nBut considering that Output4 has values appearing in certain rows based on shifts from their original positions.\n\nAssuming this is a cyclic column shift down by one:\n\nThe Python function would look like this.\n\ndef shift_columns(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0])\n    shifted = []\n    for c in range(n):\n        col = [matrix[r][c] for r in range(m)]\n        # shift down by 1\n        new_col = [col[-1]] + col[:-1]\n        row = []\n        for r in range(m):\n            if (r % m) == 0:\n                row.append(new_col[r])\n            else:\n                row.append(0)\n        shifted.append(row)\n    return shifted\n\nWait, but perhaps shifting each column down once.\n\nBut then, the code above may not be correct. Let me think: If we have a column [a,b,c], shifting down by one would make it [c,a,b]. So new_col = col[-1:] + col[:-1] which is for [c,a,b].\n\nYes.\n\nSo in each column c:\n\nnew_col = [matrix[m-1][c]] followed by matrix[0 to m-2][c]\n\nThen, reconstruct the row: each row i has its j-th element as new_col[i], but only if within bounds.\n\nWait perhaps I should write a function that shifts each column down once. So for each cell (i,j), after shifting, it's at (i+1 mod m) in that column.\n\nBut when building the shifted matrix, how to reconstruct it?\n\nPerhaps:\n\nshifted = []\nfor c in range(n):\n    col = [matrix[r][c] for r in range(m)]\n    new_col = [0]*m\n    new_col[-1] = col[0]\n    for i in range(m-1):\n        new_col[i] = col[i+1]\n    shifted.append(new_col)\nreturn [row for row in zip(*shifted)]\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[[a,b],\n [c,d],\n [e,f]]\n\nShift each column down once. So column a becomes [e,a,c], etc?\n\nNo: Wait shifting down by one would make the bottom element move to top.\n\nSo original col for first column is [a,c,e]. After shift, new_col should be [e,a,c].\n\nWait no, actually:\n\nShifting down a list of elements once means that each element moves down by one position. The last element becomes the first.\n\nFor example: [1,2,3] shifted down once \u2192 [3,1,2].\n\nSo in code, to shift a column down once, new_col = col[-1:] + col[:-1]\n\nYes.\n\nThus:\n\ndef shift_columns(matrix):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0])\n    shifted_cols = []\n    for c in range(n):\n        col = [matrix[r][c] for r in range(m)]\n        new_col = col[-1:] + col[:-1]\n        # Now, create a row from this column\n        # For each row i, take the (i-th) element of new_col if available, else 0?\n        # Wait no: we have to place these values into rows.\n        # Because shifting columns affects across all rows.\n        # So for shifted matrix, each row will consist of elements from each column's new position.\n\nWait perhaps a better approach is to transpose the matrix after shifting the columns and then transpose back. Or maybe it's easier to construct each row by taking the corresponding element from each new_col in order.\n\nAlternatively, if I shift all columns down once, for every cell (i,j) in the original, its value will be moved to (j+1 mod m). So after shifting, each column is shifted down by one, so rows get their elements from the next row's position in that column.\n\nBut perhaps when reconstructing, it's better to shift all columns and then transpose?\n\nWait no: if you have a matrix of size m x n:\n\nAfter shifting each column down once, each column c becomes [row_{c}[m-1], row_0[c], ..., row_{m-2}[c]].\n\nThus, for each new_col, it's col[-1] followed by the rest. So when constructing the shifted matrix, each row i will consist of elements from the columns' new_cols at position i.\n\nWait no: Wait after shifting column c down once, the first element is now at row 0 in that column? Or no?\n\nNo, perhaps I'm mixing up rows and columns here.\n\nLet me clarify with an example:\n\nOriginal matrix (rows x cols):\n\nRow 0: A B C\n\nRow 1: D E F\n\nRow 2: G H I\n\nShifting each column down once. So for the first column [A,D,G], after shifting, it becomes [G,A,D]. Then, when reconstructing the rows:\n\nThe new matrix would have row 0 as [G,D,A], but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait no\u2014maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of each column being shifted down. So for each column c, its elements are rotated downward by one, so that each element moves to a lower row, with the last moving to top.\n\nSo, after shifting:\n\nOriginal: \n\nRow 0: A B C\n\nRow 1: D E F\n\nRow 2: G H I\n\nAfter shift columns down once:\n\nColumn 0 becomes [G,A,D] \u2014 wait no. Wait in column c=0, original is [A; D; G]. Shifting down would make it become [G; A; D].\n\nSo the new column is [G, A, D], which means for row 0: value G (from original row 2), row1: A (original row 0), row2: D (original row 1).\n\nThus, when reconstructing the matrix:\n\nNew matrix after shifting columns down once would be:\n\nRow 0: G, H, I\n\nRow 1: A, B, C\n\nRow 2: D, E, F\n\nWait that's just rotating the rows. Because each column is shifted to have the last element at top.\n\nBut in this case, new_col for c=0 would be [G,A,D], so when creating row 0 from all columns' first elements:\n\nrow0[0] = G (from col0), row0[1]=H(from col1)... etc?\n\nWait no: Each column's shifted values are now at each row.\n\nSo the new matrix is constructed by taking, for each row r in 0..m-1, the value from column c at position (c, r) which is original_col[c][-1 - (r % m)] ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of shifting each column down once and then take transposed.\n\nWait but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try implementing this in code step by step.\n\nFirst, let's get the matrix:\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    ['D', 'E', 'F'],\n    ['G', 'H', 'I']\n]\n\nWe want to shift each column down once. So for c=0:\n\noriginal_col = ['A','D','G']\n\nshifted_col = ['G','A','D']\n\nSimilarly, c=1: shifted_col = ['H','B','E']\n\nc=2: ['I','C','F']\n\nThen the new matrix after shifting each column is constructed by taking the first element of each shifted_col as row0:\n\nrow0: G H I\n\nWait no. Because for shifted_col[0], which is 'G', it's in position (r=0, c=0). Similarly, for shifted_col[1] = ['H','B','E'], its r=0 is 'H'. So the new row 0 would be G,H,I.\n\nRow1: A,B,C\n\nRow2: D,E,F.\n\nWait but that's exactly how it was before. No change?\n\nNo, because shifting columns down once leads to each column being rotated so their first element comes from the bottom of the original. But when we transpose and shift rows, perhaps no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not do that.\n\nPerhaps a better way is: for each row in the new matrix, it takes elements diagonally from the shifted columns.\n\nWait this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: For shifting all columns down once, each element at (r,c) will move to (r+1 mod m, c). So the code would:\n\nfor r in range(m):\n    for c in range(n):\n        new_matrix[(r + 1) % m][c] = matrix[r][c]\n\nBut that's a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a cyclic shift on each row. Wait no: columns are shifted, rows remain as they are except the elements within a column have moved vertically.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated for me to visualize without writing it out.\n\nMaybe let's think of shifting each column down once:\n\nEach column [A,D,G] becomes [G,A,D].\n\nThen, when creating row0 from these columns' new_cols[0]:\n\nRow0: G (from col0), H (col1), I (col2) \u2192 same as original rows.\n\nWait that suggests no change. But wait, shifting each column down once doesn't change the matrix because it's only rotating each column downward by one row, but when you have an odd number of rows?\n\nNo: In 3x3 case, shifting a column down once makes:\n\nOriginal column0: A (row0), D(row1), G(row2)\n\nAfter shift, new_col0 is [G,A,D], which means in the new matrix, position row0 is G, row1 is A, row2 is D.\n\nSo for each row r and column c:\n\nnew_matrix[r][c] = original_matrix[(r - 1) mod m][c]\n\nBecause shifting down once: each element moves to next lower row. So if you have a new matrix, the first element of each shifted column becomes G, which was in row2.\n\nThus, for r=0 in new matrix, it's taking from (row = (r - 1) mod m), i.e., (-1 mod3)=2 \u2192 original row2.\n\nSo shifting down once would take rows:\n\nnew_row[r] is built by [original_row[(r-1)%m][c] for all c]\n\nBut that complicates the code. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use a helper function or iterate over each column and shift its elements vertically.\n\nIn Python, with NumPy arrays, you could easily do this:\n\nnew_matrix = np.roll(matrix, 1, axis=0)\n\nWhich rolls along the first dimension (rows), shifting up by one. But that's for row-wise rotation.\n\nWait no: roll(1, axis=0) would shift rows upward; so row0 becomes row1, etc., last row comes to top.\n\nBut wait, if we have 3x3 matrix:\n\nOriginal:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nAfter rolling once (axis=0):\n\nG H I\nA B C\nD E F\n\nWhich is equivalent to shifting each column down by one. Because the first row becomes G,H,I.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for NumPy, this would be easy: np.roll(matrix, shift=1, axis=0). But since in standard Python lists, we can't do that; so perhaps I need a different approach without using NumPy.\n\nAlternatively, if the code is allowed to use NumPy, then it could be:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nmatrix = [[A,B,C],[D,E,F],[G,H,I]]\nshifted_matrix = np.roll(matrix, 1, axis=0)\n\nBut in standard Python lists, perhaps I can't rely on that.\n\nSo for the purposes of this problem, assuming we can use NumPy's roll function with a row shift. But since in code submission platforms sometimes have limitations, but given it was mentioned that rolling is acceptable, let's proceed with an alternative approach without NumPy if possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create shifted_matrix by iterating through each column and shifting the elements.\n\nIn standard Python:\n\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\nshifted_matrix = []\nfor c in range(cols):\n    # get the current column as a list\n    col = [row[c] for row in matrix]\n    # shift down once: last element becomes first, others move down.\n    shifted_col = col[-1:] + col[:-1]\n    new_row = ''.join(shifted_col)  # if it's strings, this would work\n    shifted_matrix.append(new_row)\n\nWait no, that just shifts each column circularly. For example:\n\ncol = [A,D,G]\n\nshifted_col becomes [G,A,D] as desired.\n\nSo for row0 in the new matrix: G (from col0), H (from col1 shifted), I (from col2 shifted). So the first row is GH... wait no, it's same as before. Because each column's elements are moved down; but when we build a new row from all columns' current rows.\n\nWait maybe not. For example:\n\nTake matrix = [[A,B,C],[D,E,F],[G,H,I]]\n\nFor c=0: col = [A,D,G] \u2192 shifted_col becomes [G,A,D]\n\nc=1: [B,E,H] \u2192 shifted_col is [H,B,E]\n\nc=2: [C,F,I] \u2192 shifted_col is [I, C, F]\n\nThen the new matrix's rows are:\n\nnew_row0: G H I\n\nnew_row1: A B C\n\nnew_row2: D E F.\n\nSo compared to original, it's same as shifting each column down once. So if you have three columns and 3 rows, the result is same because each shift brings the last element of the column to first row. But in a general case with different number of rows and columns?\n\nLet me see for a more complex matrix.\n\nSuppose matrix = [\n    ['A', 'B'],\n    ['C', 'D'],\n    ['E', 'F']\n]\n\nrows=3, cols=2\n\nshifting each column down once:\n\nc=0: [A,C,E] \u2192 shifted_col becomes [E,A,C]\nc=1: [B,D,F] \u2192 shifted_col becomes [F,B,D]\n\nSo new matrix's rows are:\nnew_row0: E F\nnew_row1: A B\nnew_row2: C D\n\nWhich is achieved by this method.\n\nBut in the initial approach, for each row in the shifted matrix, it's built from taking the current elements of that row. So how do we arrange that?\n\nWait no: if I have:\n\nshifted_col = col[-1:] + col[:-1]\n\nThen for c=0, shifted_col is [E,A,C], so new_row would be E A C.\n\nBut when there are multiple columns, each column's shifted elements will form a row. So the resulting matrix has rows as follows: first row is all column 0's shifted entries, second row is column1's shifted entries? No that can't be.\n\nWait no, perhaps not:\n\nIn above example with 3x2 matrix:\n\ncolumns are [A,C,E] and [B,D,F].\n\nshifted_col for c=0 is [E,A,C], which has three elements. Then the new_row will consist of E (from column0), then B? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no: each shifted_col is a list with len equal to cols. So when you take all columns' shifted_cols and arrange them as rows:\n\nWait in our earlier example for 3x2 matrix, after shifting each column down once:\n\nshifted_col_c0 = [E,A,C]\n\nshifted_col_c1 = [F,B,D]\n\nThen new matrix is built by taking the first element of each shifted_col to form row0: E F\n\nsecond elements: A B \u2192 row1\n\nthird elements: C D \u2192 row2.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because shifting down once would move all columns' rows down. So perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor a matrix with R rows and C columns,\n\nshifted_matrix has rows where each row r in shifted_matrix is the column r-1 (mod C) of the original, with elements rotated down.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternative approach: for each new_row index r_new, it should be equal to the original's [r_prev] where r_prev = (r_new - 1) mod R.\n\nSo for a matrix with rows R and columns C:\n\nshifted_matrix[r][c] = original_matrix[(r-1) % R][c]\n\nWhich can be constructed by creating each row as the shifted version of its respective column.\n\nBut in code terms, without using NumPy's roll function (which is allowed?), perhaps I can implement this as follows:\n\nFor a given matrix, create a new matrix where each row r is built from [row[(r - 1) % R][c] for c in columns].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Determine the number of rows and columns.\n\nrows = len(matrix)\n\nif rows ==0: return []\n\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n2. For each new_row_index in 0 to (rows-1):\n\nnew_row = [matrix[(new_row_index -1) % rows][c] for c in range(cols)]\n\n3. Append this new_row to shifted_matrix.\n\nWait, let me test with our earlier examples:\n\nExample 1: matrix is a list of lists.\n\nCase where R=3, C=2:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n[ ['A','B'],\n  ['C','D'],\n  ['E','F'] ]\n\nShifted matrix should be:\n\nFor r in 0, new_row is row (0-1) mod3 = 2. So for c=0: E, c=1: F \u2192 [E,F]\n\nr=1: (1-1)=0 \u2192 A,B\n\nr=2: (2-1)=1 \u2192 C,D.\n\nSo shifted matrix becomes:\n\n[ ['E','F'], \n  ['A','B'],\n  ['C','D'] ]\n\nWhich is correct for shifting each column down once. So yes, this approach works.\n\nAnother example with R=3 and C=3:\n\nOriginal:\n[[A,B,C],\n [D,E,F],\n [G,H,I]]\n\nshifted matrix according to the method above would be:\n\nr=0: (0-1) mod3 = 2 \u2192 row is G,H,I\n\nr=1: 0 \u2192 A,B,C\n\nr=2:1\u2192 D,E,F.\n\nWhich matches what I saw earlier with NumPy's roll function, so this approach works.\n\nSo code steps in Python:\n\ndef shift_matrix(matrix):\n    if not matrix or len(matrix) ==0:\n        return []\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    shifted = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        prev_r = (r -1) % rows\n        new_row = [matrix[prev_r][c] for c in range(cols)]\n        shifted.append(new_row)\n    return shifted\n\nWait wait, no:\n\nIn this code, 'r' is the index of the new row. For each new_row r, prev_r is (r-1) mod rows.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with R=3 and C=2 as before: it produces [E,F], A,B, C,D which is correct.\n\nBut another test case:\n\nOriginal 2x2 matrix:\n\n[[A,B],\n [C,D]]\n\nShifted should be for row0: (0-1) mod2 \u21921\u2192 D,A ?\n\nWait no. Wait in our earlier approach, shifted_matrix[r] = previous row of original matrix's rth new_row.\n\nWait wait: let me think with R=2:\n\nFor each new_row r:\n\nprev_r is (r -1) mod R\n\nSo for r=0: prev_r is 1 \u2192 [C,D]\n\nfor r=1: prev_r is 0 \u2192 [A,B]\n\nWhich means shifted matrix would be [[C,D], [A,B]].\n\nYes, that's correct. Each column has been shifted down once:\n\nOriginal columns are [A,C] and [B,D].\n\nAfter shifting each row (which is equivalent to moving each row's elements one step up), the new rows become [C,A] for c=0? Wait no: wait, when R=2.\n\nWait in this case, using code logic, for r=0:\n\nprev_r = 1 \u2192 original matrix[1][c], which are C and D. So shifted row is [C,D]\n\nr=1: prev_r=0 \u2192 A,B\n\nSo the new matrix becomes [[C,D], [A,B]]\n\nWhich represents each column having been shifted once down, because in the first column:\n\noriginal was [A,C] \u2192 shifted by 2 steps (down twice) would be C,A?\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps our approach is correct and that for a 2x2 matrix, it's working as intended. So shifting each column down once results in [[C,D], [A,B]] which is equivalent to the code's output.\n\nSo seems like this method works regardless of row count or column count.\n\nAnother test: single-row matrix:\n\nmatrix = [['a','b']]\n\nrows=1, cols=2\n\nfor r in 0 \u2192 prev_r=(0-1) mod1=0 (since -1%1 is 0).\n\nnew_row will be [a,b].\n\nSo shifted matrix is same as original.\n\nBut wait: when rows are 1 and we shift each column down once. But shifting a single row's columns would not change anything, which makes sense since it's just one element per column. So the code correctly returns the same matrix.\n\nWhat about multiple columns but only one row? For example:\n\nmatrix = [[1,2,3]]\n\nShifted according to code: [ (0-1) mod1=0 \u2192 new_row is 1,2,3]\n\nSo again, no change because there's only one row. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about a single-element matrix?\n\nmatrix = [[5]]\n\nshifted would be same as original.\n\nSo our approach works in these cases.\n\nNow, testing with the initial example where R=3 and C=3:\n\nThe code will produce for r=0 \u2192 prev_r is 2: [G,H,I]\n\nr=1 \u2192 prev_r=0: [A,B,C]\n\nr=2\u2192prev_r=1: [D,E,F].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case with R=4, matrix has rows from A to D:\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['a','b'],\n    ['c','d'],\n    ['e','f'],\n    ['g','h']\n]\n\nShifted should be for each new_row r:\n\nr0: row3 \u2192 g,h\n\nr1: row0 \u2192 a,b\n\nr2: row1\u2192 c,d\n\nr3: row2\u2192 e,f\n\nThus, the shifted matrix is:\n[\n    ['g','h'],\n    ['a','b'],\n    ['c','d'],\n    ['e','f']\n]\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nHence, our code logic works.\n\nSo now, in Python, we can implement this as:\n\ndef shift_matrix(matrix):\n    if not matrix or len(matrix) == 0:\n        return []\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    shifted = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        prev_r = (r -1) % rows\n        new_row = [matrix[prev_r][c] for c in range(cols)]\n        shifted.append(new_row)\n    return shifted\n\nBut wait, what if the matrix has varying column lengths? Like some row is longer than others. But I think that's beyond the scope of this problem as we can assume all rows have same length.\n\nNow, testing with a sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nmatrix = [\n    ['a','b'],\n    ['c','d']\n]\n\nExpected output after shifting: Each column shifted once down \u2192 resulting in [['c','d'], ['a','b']].\n\nWhich our code produces correctly.\n\nAnother test case where rows are more than two:\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['x', 'y'],\n    ['z', 'w'],\n    ['v', 'u']\n]\n\nShifted will be [[v,u], [x,y], [z,w]]\n\nWait, no: for r in 0,1,2.\n\nr=0 \u2192 prev_r=( -1 ) mod3 = 2 \u2192 matrix[2][0] and [2][1] are v, u \u2192 new_row is ['v', 'u'].\n\nr=1 \u2192 (0) \u2192 ['x','y']\n\nr=2\u2192(1) \u2192 ['z','w']\n\nThus shifted matrix will be:\n\n[\n    ['v', 'u'],\n    ['x', 'y'],\n    ['z', 'w']\n]\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nAnother possible corner case is when the matrix has zero rows or one row. As tested earlier, it's handled correctly.\n\nTherefore, this code should solve the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to shift each column of a given matrix down by one position. This means that each element in the columns will move down, and the last element of each column will wrap around to the top of that column.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - The task is to shift each column downward by one row. For example, if a column has elements [A, B, C], after shifting, it should become [C, A, B].\n   - We need to handle edge cases such as single-row matrices or empty matrices.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - For each new row in the resulting matrix, we can derive it from the previous row of the original matrix. Specifically, for a given row index `r` in the new matrix, its data comes from the row `(r-1) % number_of_rows` in the original matrix.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Check if the matrix is empty and return an empty list if it is.\n   - Determine the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) in the matrix.\n   - For each new row index `r`, compute the corresponding previous row index as `(r-1) % rows`.\n   - Construct each new row by taking elements from this computed previous row.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef shift_matrix(matrix):\n    if not matrix or len(matrix) == 0:\n        return []\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    shifted = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        prev_r = (r - 1) % rows\n        new_row = [matrix[prev_r][c] for c in range(cols)]\n        shifted.append(new_row)\n    return shifted\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function first checks if the matrix is empty and returns an empty list immediately.\n- **Matrix Dimensions**: It calculates the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`).\n- **Row Construction**: For each row index `r` in the new matrix, it computes the corresponding previous row index using modulo arithmetic to handle wrap-around. This ensures that even when moving beyond the first or last row, we correctly reference an existing row.\n- **Building New Rows**: Each element of the new row is taken from the corresponding column of the previously computed row.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the shifted matrix by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular shifts and ensuring all edge cases are handled gracefully.", "User: This is test input matrix:\n\n\n200\n200\n000\n\nPredict the output matrix.", "User: This is test input matrix:\n\n\n200\n200\n000\n\nPredict the output matrix.", "Bot: <think>\nOkay, I need to predict the output matrix after applying the shift_matrix function to the given input. The input matrix consists of three rows:\n\nRow 1: 200\nRow 2: 200\nRow 3: 000\n\nFirst, let me visualize this as a list in Python:\nmatrix = [\n    ['2', '0', '0'],\n    ['2', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0']\n]\n\nNow, according to the shift_matrix function, each column's elements are shifted down by one. That means for each new row, it takes the element from the previous row in the original matrix.\n\nLet me go through the steps:\n\nFor r=0 (first row of the output):\nprev_r = (0-1) % 3 = (-1) % 3 = 2\nSo, new_row is [matrix[2][0], matrix[2][1], matrix[2][2]] \u2192 ['0', '0', '0']\n\nFor r=1 (second row of the output):\nprev_r = (1-1) % 3 = 0\nnew_row is [matrix[0][0], matrix[0][1], matrix[0][2]] \u2192 ['2', '0', '0']\n\nFor r=2 (third row of the output):\nprev_r = (2-1) % 3 = 1\nnew_row is [matrix[1][0], matrix[1][1], matrix[1][2]] \u2192 ['2', '0', '0']\n\nSo, the shifted matrix should be:\n\n[\n    ['0','0','0'],\n    ['2','0','0'],\n    ['2','0','0']\n]\n\nI think that's correct based on the function logic.\n</think>\n\nThe given input matrix is:\n\n[\n    ['2', '0', '0'],\n    ['2', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0']\n]\n\nAfter applying the `shift_matrix` function, each column is shifted down by one row. Here's how it's done step-by-step:\n\n1. For r=0:\n   - prev_r = (0-1) % 3 = 2\n   - new_row becomes matrix[2] \u2192 ['0', '0', '0']\n\n2. For r=1:\n   - prev_r = (1-1) % 3 = 0\n   - new_row becomes matrix[0] \u2192 ['2', '0', '0']\n\n3. For r=2:\n   - prev_r = (2-1) % 3 = 1\n   - new_row becomes matrix[1] \u2192 ['2', '0', '0']\n\nThe resulting shifted matrix is:\n\n[\n    ['0','0','0'],\n    ['2','0','0'],\n    ['2','0','0']\n]\n\nSo, the output matrix after shifting is:\n\n[[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0]]"]
