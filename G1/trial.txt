Input 1:

There is a black background canvas represented by color '0', the root (Root) of the shape parsed tree contains background color: black.
Root has size of 13x15. Root has 3 child: A, B, C;
A has color '1': red, it is a red rectangle of dimension 6x5, with top left cell at index (1, 2).
B has color '2': blue, it is a blue rectangle of dimension 3x3, with top left cell at index (1, 10).
C has color '3': green, it is a green rectangel of dimension 5x7, with top left cell at index (8, 8).

The infix notation to represent tree is given as:

Root(A, B, C)

This input tree is now transformed to output tree.
