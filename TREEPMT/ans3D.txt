Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a pixel matrix and wants us to convert it into a tree representation using infix notation. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

First, the input is a 7x8 matrix (since there are 7 rows, each with 8 characters, but looking at the input, I see 7 rows of 8, then two more rows of 8? Wait, the user's input matrix is:

00000000

02222200

02111200

02121200

02111200

02222200

00000000

00000000

Wait, that's 8 rows. Each line has 8 characters. So the matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns. Let me count again:

1. 00000000 (row 0)

2. 02222200 (row 1)

3. 02111200 (row 2)

4. 02121200 (row 3)

5. 02111200 (row 4)

6. 02222200 (row 5)

7. 00000000 (row 6)

8. 00000000 (row 7)

Wait, that's 8 rows. So the matrix is 8x8. The background is 0. The other digits are shapes. We need to find connected regions of non-zero pixels, each forming a distinct shape. Then, determine their hierarchy based on bounding boxes.

So first step: identify all connected components (shapes) in the matrix. Each connected component is a group of pixels with the same color connected via their edges (assuming 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity? The problem statement says "connected non-zero pixels", but doesn't specify. However, in the examples, like example 1, the 2's form a rectangle, so perhaps the shapes are considered as rectangles. Wait, maybe the problem defines a "shape" as a connected region, but the minimal bounding rectangle for it. So each shape is a rectangle. Wait, the problem says "minimal bounding rectangle enclosing each shape". So each shape is a connected region, and the minimal rectangle that contains all its pixels is the bounding box. The shape itself may not be a rectangle, but the bounding box is.

Wait, but in example 1, the shapes are rectangles, but perhaps in this problem, the connected regions can be any shape, but their minimal bounding rectangle is considered. So for each connected component (same color, connected), find the minimal rectangle that contains all their pixels, then arrange these rectangles in a hierarchy based on containment.

But then, the hierarchy is determined by which rectangle is contained within another. So parent nodes are those whose bounding boxes contain the bounding boxes of children. And each node's color is the color of the connected component (but the problem says the color is the digit, so each shape is a connected component of a single color? Because the problem states "connected non-zero pixels" and each shape is formed by connected non-zero. So each shape is a single color, since it's connected and same color. Because otherwise, if two different colors are connected, they wouldn't form a single shape.

Wait, the problem says: "distinct shape is formed by connected non-zero pixels." So a shape is a connected region (4 or 8-connected?) of the same color. So each shape is a single color. So for example, if there are two adjacent 2s and 3s, they are separate shapes.

But in the given input matrix, let's look at it:

Row 0: all 0s. So background.

Row 1: 0, then five 2s, then two 0s.

Row 2: 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0.

Row 3: 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0.

Row 4: same as row 2.

Row 5: same as row 1.

Row 6 and 7: all 0s.

So the non-zero regions are:

First, the outer ring of 2s: in rows 1-5 (from row 1 to row 5), columns 1-5 (since row 1 has 2s from column 1 to 5, but wait, row 1 is 02222200. Columns are 0-based or 1-based? The problem's example uses 1-based positions. For example, in example 1, the top-left cell is (1,2). So probably 1-based.

So in row 1 (second row if 0-based), the 2s start at column 1 (0-based column 1) and span to column 5. So the outer shape (the 2's) forms a rectangle? Let's see.

Looking at the 2's:

In row 1 (index 1 in 0-based), columns 1-5 (0-based 1 to 5) are 2s.

In row 5 (index 5), same as row 1: 02222200. So columns 1-5 are 2s.

Rows 2,3,4: columns 1 and 5 (0-based) are 2s. For example, row 2 is 02111200: columns 1 is 2, column 5 is 2.

So the 2s form a rectangle? Because their minimal bounding box would be from row 1 to row 5 (inclusive), and columns 1 to 5 (inclusive). So the bounding box is 5 rows high (rows 1-5) and 5 columns wide (columns 1-5). So the minimal rectangle covering all 2s is this. But within this rectangle, there are other pixels: 1s and 2s.

Inside this rectangle, there's a region of 1s. For example, rows 2-4 (0-based 2,3,4), columns 2-4 (0-based 2,3,4). Let's check:

Row 2 (0-based index 2): 0 2 1 1 1 2 0 0 → columns 2-4 are 1s.

Row 3: 0 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 → columns 2:1, 3:2, 4:1. So the 1s are not connected here. Wait, but this might form a cross shape. Let's see. The 1s in row 2 (columns 2-4) are 1s. Row 3 has 1s at column 2 and 4. Row 4 is same as row 2: columns 2-4 are 1s.

So the 1s form a cross-like shape, with a 2 in the center (row 3, column 3).

So the 1s are in positions:

Row 2: columns 2-4 (1s)

Row 3: columns 2 (1), column 4 (1)

Row 4: columns 2-4 (1s)

So the connected 1s here. Let's check if they form a connected region. Assuming 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right):

In row 2, column 2 is connected to columns 3 and 4. Row 3, column 2 is connected to row 2, column 2 (so part of the same region). Similarly, row 3, column 4 is connected to row 2, column 4. Then row 4, columns 2-4 are connected to each other and to row 3, column 2 and 4. Wait, but row 3, column 3 is 2, so the 1s in row 3 columns 2 and 4 are separate? Let's see.

Wait, the 1s in row 2 columns 2-4 are connected. Then in row 3, column 2 is 1, which is connected to row 2 column 2. Row 3 column 4 is 1, connected to row 2 column 4. Then row 4 columns 2-4 are connected to row 3 column 2 and 4? Wait, row 4 column 2 is connected to row 3 column 2 (up). Similarly, row 4 column 4 is connected to row 3 column 4 (up). So the entire 1 region is connected, forming a cross-like shape with the center being a 2 (row 3, column 3).

So the 1s form a connected component. Their minimal bounding box would be rows 2-4 (0-based 2,3,4) and columns 2-4 (0-based 2,3,4). Because in row 3, column 2 and 4 are 1s, but column 3 is 2. So the minimal bounding box for the 1s is rows 2 to 4, columns 2 to 4. Because in row 3, the leftmost 1 is column 2 and the rightmost is column 4.

So the bounding box for the 1s is 3 rows (2-4) and 3 columns (2-4). However, within this box, there's a 2 in the center (row3, column3). So the 1s form a connected region that is split by a 2. But since the 2 is a different color, it's a separate shape.

Wait, but the 2 in the center (row3, column3) is part of the outer 2's structure. Let's see.

So the outer 2's bounding box is rows 1-5, columns 1-5.

The 1's bounding box is rows 2-4, columns 2-4.

Then, within the 1's bounding box, there's the central pixel (row3, column3) which is 2. So that 2 is part of the outer 2's shape. Wait, but in row3, column3 is 2. Let's check the outer 2's region. The outer 2s form the perimeter of a rectangle. The 2s are on the borders of their bounding box (rows 1-5, columns1-5). For example:

Row1 (0-based 1): columns1-5 are 2s.

Row5 (0-based 5): same as row1.

Columns1 in rows2-4 are 2s (row2: column1 is 2, row3: column1 is 2, row4: column1 is 2).

Similarly, column5 in rows2-4 are 2s.

So the outer 2s form a rectangular border, with the inside (rows2-4, columns2-4) being filled with 1s and a central 2.

Wait, the 1s are in rows2-4, columns2-4, but in row3, column3 is a 2. So that 2 is part of the outer shape? Because it's connected to the other 2s.

So let's see: the 2 in row3, column3 is connected to the outer 2s. How?

In row3, column3 is 2. The surrounding pixels: above (row2, column3) is 1 (so not 2), left (row3, column2) is 1, right (row3, column4) is 1, down (row4, column3) is 1. So this 2 is isolated. It's a single pixel of 2 surrounded by 1s and a 2 in row3, column1 and column5. Wait, but how is this pixel connected to the outer 2s?

If the 2s are connected via 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right), then the 2 at (3,3) is not connected to any other 2. Because all adjacent pixels are 1s except possibly row3, column0 (which is 0). So this 2 is a separate connected component. So that pixel is a single-pixel shape of color 2.

But in that case, the outer 2s form a rectangular border (the perimeter), and the inner 2 is a separate shape.

So now, let's list all the connected components:

1. The outer border of 2s: this includes all 2s except the single pixel at (3,3).

Wait, but the outer 2s are connected. Let's check:

In row1, columns1-5 are 2s. The 2s in row1 are connected to each other. Then, row2, column1 and column5 are 2s. These are connected to row1's 2s. Similarly, row5's columns1-5 are 2s, connected to row4's column1 and 5. So the outer 2s form a connected component.

But the single 2 in (3,3) is isolated. So that's another connected component of 2s.

Wait, but the problem says that shapes are formed by connected non-zero pixels. So each connected component (with same color) is a shape. So the outer 2s form a connected component (the perimeter), and the central 2 is another connected component (single pixel). So that's two shapes of color 2.

Wait, but maybe the central 2 is part of the outer 2s? Because in 8-connectivity, maybe the central 2 is connected via diagonal. But the problem didn't specify the connectivity. The examples suggest 4-connectivity, but it's not clear. Let's assume 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for this problem.

So the central 2 is a single-pixel shape. So in the matrix, there are three shapes:

- The outer perimeter of 2s (color 2), which forms a connected component.

- The cross-shaped 1s (color 1), which is a connected component.

- The single-pixel 2 (color 2) in (3,3).

But wait, how are the cross-shaped 1s connected? Let's check:

The 1s in row2, columns2-4 are connected. The 1s in row3, columns2 and 4 are connected to row2's columns2 and 4, respectively. The 1s in row4, columns2-4 are connected to row3's columns2 and 4. So the entire 1 region is connected via 4-connectivity.

Yes, for example, the 1 at (2,2) is connected to (3,2). The 1 at (2,4) is connected to (3,4). The 1s in row4 are connected to row3's 1s. So the 1s form a connected region.

So the three shapes are:

1. The outer 2's perimeter (color 2), bounding box rows1-5 (0-based) (rows 1 to 5 inclusive), columns1-5.

2. The cross-shaped 1's (color 1), bounding box rows2-4, columns2-4.

3. The single-pixel 2 (color 2) at (3,3).

But wait, the single-pixel 2's bounding box is just row3, column3 (assuming 1-based indices, but in 0-based it's (3,3) which is row3, column3). So its bounding box is 1x1.

Now, the hierarchy is determined by which bounding boxes are contained within others. The root is the entire canvas (size 8x8, color 0), but according to the problem's examples, the root is the canvas, and its children are the top-level shapes (those not contained within any other shape except the canvas).

Wait, the problem says: "the root node is the entire canvas, which has a color of 0 (background). All other shapes are children (direct or indirect) of the root, provided they are not contained within any other shape except the canvas."

So the root is the entire matrix (size 8x8, color 0), and its children are shapes whose bounding boxes are not contained within any other shape's bounding box except the canvas.

Wait, no. The root is the canvas (color 0, size 8x8). Then, the shapes are arranged in the tree based on containment. So a shape A is a child of B if A's bounding box is contained within B's bounding box, and there's no other shape C such that A is contained within C and C is contained within B.

So to build the hierarchy, we need to arrange the shapes such that each shape's parent is the smallest possible containing bounding box.

In this case:

- The outer 2's bounding box is rows1-5, columns1-5. This is contained within the canvas (root).

- The cross-shaped 1's bounding box is rows2-4, columns2-4. This is contained within the outer 2's bounding box.

- The single 2's bounding box is row3, column3. This is contained within the cross-shaped 1's bounding box.

So the hierarchy would be: root → outer 2 → cross-shaped 1 → single 2.

But wait, the single 2's bounding box (row3, column3) is contained within the cross-shaped 1's bounding box (rows2-4, columns2-4). Therefore, the single 2 would be a child of the cross-shaped 1's shape. However, the cross-shaped 1's shape's bounding box is contained within the outer 2's shape. So the hierarchy is root → outer 2 → cross-shaped 1 → single 2.

But wait, let's check the color of each shape. The outer 2 is color 2. The cross-shaped 1 is color 1. The single 2 is color 2.

But when building the hierarchy, the z-index comes into play. Children have higher z-index than parents. So if two shapes overlap, the child's color takes precedence.

In this case, the single 2's bounding box is inside the cross-shaped 1's bounding box. However, the cross-shaped 1's color is 1, and the single 2's color is 2. But since the single 2 is a child of the cross-shaped 1, its color should override where they overlap. However, the cross-shaped 1's pixels are all 1s except where the single 2 is. But according to the matrix, the pixel at row3, column3 is 2, which is part of the single 2's shape. So the hierarchy correctly represents that the single 2's color takes precedence over the cross-shaped 1.

But now, how does the hierarchy structure look? The outer 2's shape is a parent of the cross-shaped 1's shape, which is a parent of the single 2's shape.

But let's check the containment:

- outer 2's bounding box is (rows1-5, cols1-5). Contains cross-shaped 1's bounding box (rows2-4, cols2-4).

- cross-shaped 1's bounding box contains the single 2's (row3, col3).

So the tree structure would be:

Root (0) → outer 2 → cross-shaped 1 → single 2.

But wait, is the cross-shaped 1's shape fully contained within the outer 2's bounding box? Yes. And the single 2's bounding box is fully contained within the cross-shaped 1's.

So the hierarchy is Root → outer 2 → cross-shaped 1 → single 2.

But according to the problem's examples, each node can have multiple children. So if a parent has multiple children, they are ordered as per their position in the infix notation.

In this case, the outer 2's shape (bounding box rows1-5, cols1-5) contains the cross-shaped 1's shape. The cross-shaped 1's shape contains the single 2's shape. So the tree is Root -> outer 2 -> cross-shaped 1 -> single 2.

But wait, the cross-shaped 1's shape's bounding box is within the outer 2's, and the single 2's is within the cross-shaped 1's. So the hierarchy is nested.

But wait, what about the cross-shaped 1's shape and the single 2's shape? The cross-shaped 1's bounding box is rows2-4, cols2-4. The single 2's is row3, col3. So the cross-shaped 1's shape contains the single 2's shape. Therefore, the single 2 is a child of the cross-shaped 1.

So the tree structure would be:

Root (0)

└── outer 2 (bounding box 1-5 rows, 1-5 cols)

└── cross-shaped 1 (bounding box 2-4 rows, 2-4 cols)

└── single 2 (bounding box row3, col3)

But wait, the outer 2's shape's bounding box is larger than the cross-shaped 1's, so the cross-shaped 1 is a child of the outer 2. The single 2's bounding box is inside the cross-shaped 1's, so it's a child of cross-shaped 1.

Thus, the infix notation would be Root(2(1(2))).

But wait, each node is represented by their color. So:

Root (color 0) → outer 2 (color 2) → cross-shaped 1 (color 1) → single 2 (color 2).

But the root's children are all top-level shapes not contained in any other shape except the root. The outer 2 is contained in the root. The cross-shaped 1 is contained in the outer 2, so it's a child of outer 2. The single 2 is contained in cross-shaped 1, so child of cross-shaped 1.

So the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))). However, in the examples, the root is called "Root" but in the infix notation, it's written as Root(...). For example, in example 1, the output was Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but the colors are represented by their digits. Wait, looking back at example 1:

In example 1, the infix notation was Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), where A, B, C are nodes with colors 2, 1, 3, etc. But in the problem's instructions, the user said that each node is represented by their color-digit. So perhaps in the infix notation, the root is represented as the color of the canvas (0), and its children are the top-level shapes. So in the infix notation, the root is 0, and its children are the shapes not contained within any other shape except the root.

So for this problem, the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))).

But wait, the problem's examples have the root as 'Root' but perhaps that's just an example. Looking back, in example 1:

The matrix has a root (canvas) with color 0. The infix notation was written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but in the structured details, each node has a color. However, the user's instruction says that the output should have the tree in infix notation where each node is represented by its color.

Wait, the instructions say:

"Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation."

But looking at the examples, in example 1's infix notation, it's written as "Root(A(D), B(E), C(F))", but the actual nodes are colors. For example, node A is color 2, node D is color 8. So perhaps in the infix notation, nodes are labeled by their color, but in cases where multiple nodes have the same color and are siblings, they need to be differentiated. But according to the problem's examples, when nodes are siblings, they are listed in the infix notation with their colors. But when multiple nodes have the same color and are in different positions, how to distinguish them?

But perhaps the problem expects that each node is represented by its color digit, and if there are multiple nodes with the same color in the same parent, they are considered as separate nodes. So for example, in the current problem, the root has one child (the outer 2). The outer 2 has one child (the cross-shaped 1). The cross-shaped 1 has one child (the single 2). So the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))).

But wait, the problem's examples use letters (A, B, C) to represent nodes, but the actual answer is supposed to use the color digits. For example, in example 1, the answer was Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but the structured details show that A is color 2, D is 8, etc. However, the user's instruction says: "each node represents a rectangular region with the same color. [...] Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation."

The user's instructions for the output probably expect the infix notation to use the color digits, with parents enclosing their children in parentheses. So for the current problem, the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))).

But let's check the matrix again. Are there any other shapes? For example, in the cross-shaped 1's region, there's a single 2 in the center. Are there any other connected components?

Looking at the matrix:

Row 3: 02121200.

So column 3 (0-based) is 2. So that's the single pixel 2.

Other than that, are there any other pixels?

The rest of the matrix is covered by 0s except the outer 2s, cross-shaped 1s, and the single 2.

So the three shapes are:

- 2 (outer perimeter)

- 1 (cross-shaped)

- 2 (single pixel)

So the hierarchy is as discussed.

But wait, the single 2's color is the same as the outer 2's. Are they considered different nodes? Yes, because they are different connected components.

So in the infix notation, each node is represented by its color digit. But when a parent has multiple children, they are listed in order. In this case, the outer 2 has one child (the 1), which has one child (the 2).

So the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))).

But wait, the problem's examples use a Root node. For example, in example 1, the infix notation starts with Root(...). However, in the user's instructions, the root is the canvas (color 0). So perhaps the infix notation should start with 0(...).

But in example 1, the infix notation is written as Root(...), but the structured details mention the root node has color 0. So perhaps the infix notation uses the root's color (0) as the first element.

In example 1's infix notation, it's written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but perhaps in the actual answer, it's supposed to be 0(...). However, in the user's example, they labeled the root as 'Root' in the infix notation but the structured details mention the root's color is 0. This is a bit confusing.

But looking back at the problem's instructions:

"In graph theory and computer science, infix notation represents trees compactly using parentheses for child nodes and commas to separate siblings."

The example given is:

For a tree 3(2, 8(1, 9)), the infix notation is 3(2, 8(1,9)).

So the nodes are represented by their color digits. The root is 3, which has children 2 and 8. The 8 has children 1 and 9.

So in this problem's case, the root is the canvas (color 0), and its children are the top-level shapes. So the infix notation should start with 0, followed by its children in parentheses.

Therefore, for the current problem, the infix notation is 0(2(1(2))).

But let's verify the hierarchy:

- The outer 2's bounding box (rows1-5, cols1-5) is contained within the root (canvas).

- The cross-shaped 1's bounding box (rows2-4, cols2-4) is contained within the outer 2's.

- The single 2's bounding box (row3, col3) is contained within the cross-shaped 1's.

So each is a direct child of its container.

Now, regarding the blueprint for each node:

For each shape, the blueprint is the minimal bounding box, filled with the shape's color. But according to the problem's examples, the blueprint is the rectangle of the bounding box filled with the color. For example, node D in example 1 is color 8, bounding box 4x3, and the blueprint is three rows of 888.

But in reality, the actual pixels may have different colors, but the blueprint represents the minimal rectangle filled with the node's color. Wait, no. The problem's examples show that the blueprint is the rectangle filled with the node's color. For example, node A in example 1 has a blueprint of 222222 repeated 5 times, forming a 5x6 rectangle. But in reality, the shape might have been a border, but the blueprint shows a solid rectangle. This suggests that the problem assumes that each shape's blueprint is a solid rectangle of the shape's color, which is not accurate. But according to the examples, even if the shape is a border, the blueprint is represented as a filled rectangle.

Wait, this is confusing. Looking back at example 1:

Node A's blueprint is a 6x5 rectangle filled with 2's. But looking at the matrix description:

In example 1's matrix, the node A (color 2) is described as having a blueprint of 222222 repeated 5 times. But in the actual matrix, the 2's form a border, not a filled rectangle. But in the structured details, the blueprint is a filled rectangle. This suggests that the problem considers each shape's blueprint to be the minimal bounding box filled with the color of the shape. But that contradicts the actual matrix. So perhaps there is a misunderstanding here.

Wait, no. The problem's examples may have a mistake, or perhaps the description is incorrect. Let me recheck example 1:

Example 1's pixel matrix includes node A (color 2) which is described as a rectangle with dimensions 6x5. The blueprint shows 5 rows of 222222 (6 columns). But in the actual matrix, the 2's might form a hollow rectangle. But the blueprint is described as a filled rectangle. This suggests that the problem considers the blueprint to be the minimal bounding box filled with the color, regardless of the actual shape. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each shape is a solid rectangle. But the example given in the problem's first example has a matrix where the outer shape is a rectangle of 2's, which is likely a hollow rectangle (given the description of the blueprint as a filled rectangle). So this suggests that the problem's examples might be incorrect, or the way the blueprint is derived is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines a "shape" as a solid rectangle. But that contradicts the matrix description. So this is a bit confusing.

But perhaps the problem is that each shape is a connected component, and the minimal bounding box is considered as the node's dimensions, but the blueprint is the actual pixels within that bounding box. For example, node A in example 1's blueprint is 6x5, filled with 2's. But in the actual matrix, perhaps the 2's form a hollow rectangle, but the problem's example shows the blueprint as filled. This is conflicting.

But given the example's blueprint description, I think that the problem expects that each shape's blueprint is the filled minimal bounding box with the shape's color. So regardless of the actual pixels, the blueprint is a solid rectangle of the color. But this is likely not the case. Perhaps the blueprint is the actual content of the minimal bounding box, but filled with the shape's color wherever the shape is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the blueprint is the exact content of the minimal bounding box. So for a shape that is a hollow rectangle, the blueprint would show the hollow rectangle. But in the problem's example 1, node D's blueprint is 4x3 filled with 8's, but looking at the matrix, the node D's shape is a filled rectangle. For example, in example 1's matrix:

The node D (color 8) has a top-left cell at (2,3) (1-based), dimensions 4x3. The blueprint is:

888

888

888

888

So four rows, three columns. So a filled rectangle.

But looking at the matrix for example 1:

In the matrix provided, the 8's are part of the larger structure. So perhaps the problem considers that each shape's blueprint is the exact pixels within the minimal bounding box.

So for the current problem:

The outer 2's bounding box is rows1-5, columns1-5 (1-based), which is 5 rows x5 columns. Within this bounding box, the actual pixels are:

Row 1: 2 2 2 2 2

Row 2: 2 1 1 1 2

Row 3: 2 1 2 1 2

Row 4: 2 1 1 1 2

Row 5: 2 2 2 2 2

So the blueprint for the outer 2 would be the entire 5x5 bounding box, but the actual pixels are a hollow rectangle (the perimeter is 2's, the inside is 1's and a central 2). However, the problem's example suggests that the blueprint is filled with the color of the node. So this is conflicting.

But according to the problem's instructions: "for each region, provide [...] blueprint". The blueprint seems to be the pixels within the bounding box. So the outer 2's blueprint would be the 5x5 matrix as per the actual pixels in that region.

But wait, the outer 2's connected component is the perimeter 2's. The minimal bounding box is 5x5. The actual pixels in this bounding box are a mix of 2's, 1's, and the central 2. But the blueprint is supposed to be the minimal bounding box filled with the shape's color. No, because the shape is defined as the connected component. The blueprint is the actual pixels of the connected component within the bounding box. Wait, no. The problem says: "Blueprint: the content of the shape's bounding box." So the blueprint would be the pixels in the bounding box, with 0's for areas not part of the shape.

Wait, but the example in the problem's first case:

Node D has a blueprint of three columns and four rows of 8's, suggesting that the shape is a solid rectangle. But according to the matrix provided, the 8's form a solid rectangle. So perhaps the problem's blueprint is the exact pixels of the shape, and non-shape pixels (even within the bounding box) are filled with 0's? Or are the non-shape pixels not part of the blueprint?

This is unclear. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "Blueprint: the content of the shape's bounding box." So for a shape, the blueprint is the pixels within the minimal bounding box of the shape. However, the shape is a connected component of non-zero pixels, so the blueprint would show the color of the shape where the shape is present, and 0's elsewhere?

No, because the shape is the connected component of non-zero pixels. So within the minimal bounding box, any pixel that is part of the shape is colored with its color, and other pixels (even if non-zero but part of other shapes) are considered as not part of this shape. Wait, no. The problem's hierarchy rules state that children have higher z-index than parents. So in overlapping areas, the child's color is shown. But each shape's blueprint is the content of its own pixels, regardless of other shapes.

But this is getting complicated. Let's refer back to the example.

In example 1, node D is color 8, and the blueprint is four rows of three 8's each. Looking at the matrix provided for example 1, the 8's are in a solid 4x3 rectangle. So the blueprint reflects the actual pixels of the shape.

So for the current problem:

- The outer 2's shape is the perimeter of 2's. Its minimal bounding box is 5x5. Within this box, the 2's are on the perimeter, and the inner pixels are 1's and a 2. But the outer 2's shape consists only of the perimeter pixels. So the blueprint for the outer 2's shape would be a 5x5 matrix where the perimeter is 2's and the inner pixels are 0's (since they are not part of the outer 2's shape).

Wait, but the 0's are background. But the inner pixels are part of other shapes. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, the blueprint for a shape is the actual pixels that belong to that shape, within the bounding box. So for the outer 2's shape, the blueprint would have 2's where the perimeter is and 0's elsewhere, but considering that the pixels not part of this shape are considered 0. However, since other shapes (like the cross-shaped 1) are children and have higher z-index, their pixels would override the parent's in the final matrix. But for the blueprint of each shape, it's the pixels that belong to that specific shape.

So, for the outer 2's shape, the blueprint is a 5x5 matrix where the perimeter is 2's and the rest are 0's. But according to the problem's example 1, the blueprint for node A (color 2) is 5 rows of 222222 (6 columns), implying that the entire bounding box is filled with 2's. This suggests that the problem's examples may have a mistake or that the blueprint is considered to be the filled rectangle, regardless of the actual pixels.

This is a critical point. If the blueprint is the filled bounding box with the color, then the hierarchy is determined by containment of bounding boxes, and the actual pixels are not considered beyond identifying the connected components and their bounding boxes. However, if the blueprint reflects the actual pixels of the shape within the bounding box, then it's more complex.

Given the confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem considers each shape's blueprint as the filled rectangle of the color within the bounding box, regardless of the actual pixels. This would align with the examples provided, where node A's blueprint is a solid rectangle of 2's.

In that case, for the current problem:

- The outer 2's shape has a bounding box of 5 rows (1-5) and 5 columns (1-5), so the blueprint is a 5x5 filled with 2's.

- The cross-shaped 1's bounding box is 3x3 (rows2-4, cols2-4), filled with 1's.

- The single 2's bounding box is 1x1, filled with 2's.

But this contradicts the actual matrix. However, given the examples, this might be the expected approach.

But wait, in example 1, node E's blueprint is 8 in a 1x1, which is correct. The problem's examples seem to show that the blueprint is the actual pixels of the shape, not the entire bounding box filled. So perhaps the blueprint is the minimal rectangle that contains the shape, and the pixels within that rectangle that belong to the shape.

So for the outer 2's shape, the blueprint would have 2's along the perimeter and 0's inside. But according to the example, the blueprint is filled with 2's. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's definition of a "shape" is a solid rectangle, and the connected components are somehow solid rectangles. This might be the case. Looking at the example 1's matrix:

The first example has a shape A which is a rectangle of 2's. The blueprint shows a filled rectangle. But in the matrix, perhaps the 2's form a solid rectangle. Let me recheck example 1:

In example 1's matrix:

The first few rows are:

002222200011100

002888200018100

002888200018100

002888200011100

002888200000000

...

So for node A (color 2), the rows are 0022222000... The 2's form a solid block in columns 2-7 (0-based) of row 1 (0-based). But in the following rows, the 2's are only in the first and seventh columns (assuming 0-based). So node A's shape is a vertical rectangle with 2's on the left and right columns and 8's in between. But the blueprint for node A is described as 6x5 filled with 2's, which contradicts the actual matrix.

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem's examples, or perhaps the blueprint represents the entire bounding box filled with the color, regardless of the actual pixels. This seems to be the case, as in example 1, node A's blueprint is filled with 2's, but the actual matrix has 8's inside.

This can only mean that the problem considers each shape's blueprint to be the minimal bounding box filled with the shape's color, not considering other colors. So regardless of overlapping or nested shapes, each shape's blueprint is a filled rectangle of its color. This is likely the case based on the examples.

So with this assumption, the current problem's shapes would have blueprints as follows:

- The outer 2's bounding box is 5 rows (1-5) by 5 columns (1-5). Blueprint is a 5x5 filled with 2's.

- The cross-shaped 1's bounding box is 3x3. Blueprint is 3x3 filled with 1's.

- The single 2's bounding box is 1x1 filled with 2's.

But according to the matrix, this is not the case. However, given the examples, this must be how the problem expects it.

So under this assumption, the structured details would be:

Canvas (Root):

- Color: 0

- Size: 8x8

- Children: outer 2.

Outer 2:

- Color: 2

- Bounding box: rows 1-5 (1-based), columns 1-5. So dimensions 5x5.

- Top-left: (1,1) (assuming 1-based).

- Children: cross-shaped 1.

Cross-shaped 1:

- Color: 1

- Bounding box: rows 2-4, columns 2-4. Dimensions 3x3.

- Top-left: (2,2).

- Children: single 2.

Single 2:

- Color: 2

- Bounding box: row3, column3. Dimensions 1x1.

- Top-left: (3,3).

- Children: none.

So the infix notation would be 0(2(1(2))).

But wait, according to the problem's examples, the infix notation includes the root's children. For example, in example 2, the infix notation is Root(A, B, C, D), which corresponds to four top-level shapes. So in our problem, the root's only child is the outer 2. The outer 2's child is the cross-shaped 1, whose child is the single 2.

Thus, the infix notation is 0(2(1(2))).

Now, the problem's instructions also require providing the structured format and the infix notation. The structured format includes for each node:

- Color

- Shape (Rectangle)

- Top-left position

- Bounding box dimensions

- Blueprint

- Children.

So for each node:

Root (color 0):

- Color: 0

- Shape: Rectangle (8x8)

- Top-left: (0,0) if 0-based, but the examples use 1-based. For example, in example 1, node A's top-left is (1,2) (1-based).

Assuming 1-based indexing:

Root's top-left is (1,1), but the entire canvas is 8x8. So dimensions are 8x8.

But the root's bounding box is the entire canvas.

Outer 2:

- Color: 2

- Shape: Rectangle (5x5)

- Top-left: (2,2) in 1-based. Because in the matrix, the outer 2's start at row 2 (1-based) and column 2 (1-based). Wait, the matrix given by the user is:

Row 1 (1-based): 02222200 → columns 2-6 (1-based) are 2s.

Wait, no. For 1-based indexing:

Row 1: 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 → columns 2-6 are 2s (columns 2 to 6 inclusive). So the top-left of the outer 2's bounding box is (row 2, column 2), but wait, the bounding box must cover all the 2's in the outer perimeter.

The minimal bounding box for the outer 2's connected component (the perimeter) would be rows 2-6 (1-based) and columns 2-6 (1-based), because:

In row 2 (1-based, which is the second row of the matrix), columns 2-6 are 2's.

In row 6 (1-based, which is the sixth row of the matrix), columns 2-6 are 2's.

Columns 2 and 6 (1-based) in rows 2-6 are also 2's.

So the minimal bounding box for the outer 2's shape is rows 2-6 (5 rows) and columns 2-6 (5 columns), hence a 5x5 rectangle starting at (2,2) in 1-based coordinates.

Wait, the matrix has 8 rows (0-based 0 to 7), so 1-based rows 1 to 8. The outer 2's are present in rows 2-6 (1-based), which correspond to 0-based rows 1-5.

So the minimal bounding box for the outer 2's shape is rows 2-6 (1-based), columns 2-6 (1-based), which is a 5x5 box.

So the top-left position is (2,2) in 1-based, which corresponds to (row=2, column=2) in 1-based.

The blueprint is 5x5 filled with 2's.

But wait, according to the problem's examples, the blueprint is filled with the color, so regardless of the actual pixels. So the outer 2's blueprint is a solid 5x5 of 2's.

The cross-shaped 1's bounding box is rows 3-5 (1-based), columns 3-5 (1-based), which is a 3x3 box. Top-left at (3,3) (1-based). Blueprint is 3x3 of 1's.

The single 2's bounding box is row 4, column 4 (1-based), 1x1. Blueprint is a single 2.

So the structured format would be:

Root Node:

- Color: 0

- Size: 8x8

- Children: 2

Node 2:

- Color: 2

- Bounding box: 5x5, top-left (2,2)

- Children: 1

- Blueprint:

22222

22222

22222

22222

22222

Node 1:

- Color: 1

- Bounding box: 3x3, top-left (3,3)

- Children: 2

- Blueprint:

111

111

111

Node 2 (child of 1):

- Color: 2

- Bounding box: 1x1, top-left (4,4)

- Children: None

- Blueprint:

2

So the infix notation is 0(2(1(2))).

But according to the problem's examples, the root is called 'Root' in the infix notation. For example, in example 1, it's written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). However, the actual color of the root is 0. So perhaps in this case, the infix notation should start with 0(2(...)).

But the user's examples use 'Root' as the root node label, but the problem's instructions say that the root is the canvas with color 0. So perhaps the infix notation should use 0 as the root.

Alternatively, perhaps the root is labeled as 'Root' regardless of color, but in the examples, the root's color is 0. This is a bit ambiguous, but looking at the examples, in example 1's infix notation, the root is labeled as Root, but in the structured details, it's color 0. So perhaps the infix notation uses 'Root' as the root node's label, followed by its children.

But the user's instructions for the current problem's output say: "Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation." The examples show the structured format with labels (A, B, C) and the infix notation using those labels. However, the user's instructions mention that each node is represented by their color-digit. So perhaps the labels (A, B, C) are for illustrative purposes, and the actual answer should use the color digits.

But in the current problem, the root has color 0. So the infix notation should start with 0(...).

Thus, the final answer's infix notation is 0(2(1(2))).

So to summarize, the steps are:

1. Identify connected components (shapes) in the matrix.

2. For each shape, determine its minimal bounding box.

3. Establish the hierarchy based on bounding box containment.

4. Represent the hierarchy in infix notation using color digits.

The connected components are:

- Outer 2's perimeter (color 2).

- Cross-shaped 1's (color 1).

- Single 2 (color 2).

Hierarchy: Root (0) → outer 2 → cross-shaped 1 → single 2.

In infix notation: 0(2(1(2))).

Infix Notation:
0(2(1(2)))

Explanation:

    The root represents the entire canvas (8x8, color 0).

    The outer 2 forms a 5x5 bounding box enclosing the cross-shaped 1.

    The 1 contains a single-pixel 2 at its center.

    The hierarchy reflects containment: Canvas → Outer 2 → Cross-Shaped 1 → Central 2.

    Infix notation compactly shows parent-child relationships using nested parentheses.
