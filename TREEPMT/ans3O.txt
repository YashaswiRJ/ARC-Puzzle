Below is one complete solution that identifies the distinct connected regions by color and then uses their minimal bounding rectangles to build the tree. In this example the canvas (background) is color 0 (an 8×8 grid). The nonzero pixels form two kinds of shapes:

    An outer border of color 2 that spans rows 1–5 and columns 1–5.

    An interior region of color 1 filling rows 2–4 and columns 2–4, inside of which there is a single pixel of color 2 at (3,3).

Because a nested shape must be completely inside its parent’s bounding box, the hierarchy is as follows:

    The canvas (color 0) is the root.

    The outer border (color 2) is a child of the canvas.

    The inner shape (color 1) is nested inside the border and so becomes the child of the border.

    Finally, the isolated color‑2 pixel at (3,3) is fully contained in the inner shape and is its child.

The details for each node are:
Node	Color	Top‑left Position	Dimensions	Blueprint
Canvas	0	(0, 0)	8 × 8	00000000
02222200
02111200
02121200
02111200
02222200
00000000
00000000
Outer	2	(1, 1)	5 × 5	22222
21112
21212
21112
22222
Inner	1	(2, 2)	3 × 3	111
121
111
Isolated	2	(3, 3)	1 × 1	2

In infix notation the hierarchy is represented by writing the parent’s color followed by its children inside parentheses (with commas for multiple children, if needed). Since each node here has one child, the final tree in infix notation is:

  0(2(1(2)))

This represents the background 0 containing the outer border 2, which in turn contains the inner shape 1, with its embedded 2 pixel.

In summary, by first segmenting the matrix into connected regions by color and then determining the minimal bounding rectangle for each, we obtain the tree structure and the corresponding infix notation: 0(2(1(2))).
