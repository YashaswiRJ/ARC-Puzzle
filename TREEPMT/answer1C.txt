Below is one complete way to represent the given pixel matrix as a hierarchical “tree” of rectangular regions using infix notation. In our solution the entire 10×10 canvas (with background digit 0) is taken as the root. Its non‐zero connected regions – one region of color 2 in the top‐right and two regions of color 1 (one in the upper area and one toward the bottom) – become its direct children. None of the non‐zero shapes nest within another, so the final tree has a root with three children.

Below are the details:

Canvas (Root Node):

    Color: 0

    Top‐left: (0, 0)

    Dimensions: 10×10

    Blueprint:
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2
      0 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 2
      0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 2
      0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
      0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
      0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0

Children of the canvas are:

Child Node A (Top‐right region):

    Color: 2

    Shape: Rectangle

    Top‐left: (1, 7)

    Dimensions: 3×3

    Blueprint:
      [2,
    Child Node B (Upper left region of nonzero area):

    Color: 1

    Shape: Rectangle

    Top‐left: (2, 1)

    Dimensions: 3×4

    Blueprint:
      [1,
    Child Node C (Lower region):

    Color: 1

    Shape: Rectangle

    Top‐left: (7, 5)

    Dimensions: 3×4

    Blueprint:
      [1,
    Infix Notation:

Since the root (canvas) encloses these three regions, we represent the
