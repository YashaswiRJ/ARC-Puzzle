Okay, let's try to figure out how to convert this given pixel matrix into a tree using infix notation. Hmm, first, I need to understand the problem properly. The input is a matrix of digits, where non-zero digits are connected regions (shapes) that form nodes in a tree. The hierarchy is determined by nesting: a child shape is entirely within the parent's bounding box and has a higher z-index. The root is the entire canvas, which is the background (color 0), but according to the examples, the root's children are the top-level shapes, which are not contained within any other shape except the canvas.

So the steps are probably:

1. Identify all distinct shapes (connected regions of the same color, non-zero) in the matrix.

2. For each shape, determine its minimal bounding rectangle (top-left position, width, height).

3. Determine the hierarchical relationships between these shapes. A shape is a child of another if its bounding box is entirely contained within the parent's, and there's no other shape that contains it which is smaller than the parent. Also, children must have a higher z-index, which I think is determined by their position in the processing order. Wait, but the z-index here probably refers to the order in which they are drawn, with children being on top of parents. So in the matrix, if two shapes' bounding boxes overlap, the one whose color is visible in the overlapping area is the child. But how do we determine which is the parent and which is the child?

Alternatively, the hierarchy is determined by containment. A child's bounding box must be entirely within the parent's. So, for each shape, its parent is the smallest shape that fully contains its bounding box. If a shape is not contained in any other (except the root canvas), it's a direct child of the root.

So the process would be:

- Find all the shapes.

- For each shape, determine all possible parents (shapes whose bounding boxes contain its own).

- The parent is the one with the smallest bounding box that still contains the current shape's bounding box. If there's no such parent (except the root), then it's a root child.

Once the parent-child relationships are established, we can build the tree. Then, represent this tree in infix notation where each node is represented by its color, and children are in parentheses separated by commas.

Now let's look at the given matrix:

The matrix is 10 rows (height 10) and 10 columns (width 10). Let's write it out:

Row 0: 0000000000

Row 1: 0000000222

Row 2: 0111100202

Row 3: 0100100222

Row 4: 0111100000

Row 5: 0000000000

Row 6: 0000000000

Row 7: 0000011110

Row 8: 0000010010

Row 9: 0000011110

First, I need to identify all connected regions. Each connected region is a group of non-zero pixels connected (assuming 4 or 8-connectedness? The problem says connected non-zero pixels, but doesn't specify. The examples seem to use 4-connected, but perhaps. Let's assume 4-connected.)

Let's start by scanning the matrix for non-zero pixels and grouping them into regions.

Let's process each cell from top to bottom, left to right. For each cell, if it's non-zero and not yet part of a region, start a flood fill (or BFS) to find all connected pixels of the same color. Then record the minimal bounding box for that region.

Let's list the regions:

Looking at row 2 (index 2) has 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 2. So the first region here is color 1, starting at (2,1) and spanning to the right. Let's see:

Row 2: positions (2,1) to (2,4) are 1s. Then in row 3, (3,1) is 1, (3,4) is 1. Then row 4: (4,1) to (4,4) are 1s. So this is a U-shaped region? Wait, let's check.

Wait row 2: columns 1-4 are 1s. Row 3: column 1 is 1, column 4 is 1, but columns 2-3 are 0s. Row 4: columns 1-4 are 1s. So this forms a region that's connected in a U-shape. But wait, how are the pixels connected? For example, (2,1) is connected to (3,1) via down, and (3,1) is connected to (4,1). Similarly, (2,4) is connected to (3,4), which is connected to (4,4). So the entire region is connected, even if the middle parts are 0. So the color is 1 here. So this region's bounding box would be from row 2 to row 4 (y coordinates 2 to 4), and columns 1 to 4 (x coordinates 1 to 4). But wait, the minimal bounding rectangle must enclose all the pixels. For example, in row 2, columns 1-4; row 3, columns 1 and 4; row 4, columns 1-4. So the minimal bounding box is from row 2 to row 4, and columns 1 to 4. So top-left is (y=2, x=1), height is 3 (rows 2,3,4), width is 4 (columns 1-4). So that's one region, color 1.

Another region is the 2s in row 1: columns 7-9 are 2, row 2 column 7 is 2, row 3 columns 7-9 are 2. Let's see:

Row 1: columns 7-9 (positions 6,7,8 in 0-based index?) Wait, the input is written as a string, so for row 1: "0000000222" — that's 10 characters. So columns 0-9. So "0000000222" has 2s starting at column 7 (index 7, 8, 9). In row 2: "0202" at columns 7 and 9. So in row 2, column 7 is 2 (position (2,7)), and column 9 is 2. Row 3: columns 7-9 are 2. So the region here: let's see if these 2s are connected. Row 1, columns 7-9: 2s. Row 2, column7 is 2, row3 columns7-9. Are these connected? Let's see: the 2s in row1, column7 is connected to row2, column7 (down). Then row3, column7 is connected to row2's 2. But row3 columns7-9: 2s. So the entire region is a big shape. Let's check the connectedness. For example, row1's 7-9 are 2s. Row2 has 2 at 7. So that's connected. Row3 has 2s from 7-9. So the minimal bounding box for this 2 region would be from row1 to row3 (y=1 to 3), columns7-9 (x=7-9). But wait, in row2, column7 is 2 but columns8-9 are 0 (since row2 is "0202" at positions 7 and 9. So the region would include (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). But how are these connected? Let's see: (1,7) is connected to (2,7) (down). (1,8) is connected to (1,7) (right). (1,9) connected to (1,8). (3,7) connected to (2,7) via down? Wait, row2's column7 is 2, row3's column7 is 2. So yes, connected. So the entire region is connected. But the minimal bounding box would be from row1 to row3 (y=1-3), columns7-9 (x=7-9). But in row2, columns8-9 are 0. But the bounding box includes all the positions where there are 2s. Wait, the minimal bounding rectangle is the smallest rectangle that contains all the pixels of the shape. So the minimal rectangle for this 2 shape would have:

min row: 1 (since there's a pixel in row1)

max row:3 (pixels in row3)

min column:7 (pixels in column7)

max column:9 (pixels in column9)

So top-left is (1,7) (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based? The examples in the problem seem to use 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the examples.

In example 1, for Node A, the top-left cell is (1,2). The matrix in example 1 is 13x15. So maybe rows and columns are 0-based? Because (1,2) would be row 1, column 2. The example's matrix for Node A has a 6x5 rectangle. So 6 columns (width) and 5 rows (height). So if the top-left is (1,2), then the bounding box spans from row 1 to row 1+5-1= row5 (if height is 5). So that's possible. So the coordinates are (y, x) where y is the row index (0-based), x is column index (0-based). So for the 2s in the current problem, the top-left is (1,7) (row1, column7), width 3 (columns7-9), height 3 (rows1-3). So that's one region, color 2.

Another region is in row7,8,9. Let's see row7: "0000011110" — columns5-8 are 1s. Row8: "0000010010" — columns5 and 8 are 1s. Row9: "0000011110" — columns5-8 are 1s. So this is a similar U-shaped region. Let's check connectivity. The 1s in row7 columns5-8 are connected. Then row8's column5 is 1 (connected to row7's column5 via down), and row8's column8 is 1 (connected to row7's column8 via down). Then row9's columns5-8 are 1s. So this forms a region that's connected through the left and right edges. The minimal bounding box here would be from row7 to row9 (y=7-9), columns5-8 (x=5-8). So top-left (7,5), width 4, height 3. Color 1.

Another region: row2, column9 is 2. Let's see if that's part of another region. Wait, in row2, column9 is 2. Is that connected to the larger 2 region? Let's check. The larger 2 region includes (2,7). The 2 at (2,9) is isolated from the others in row2. Because in row2, columns7 and 9 are 2s. But column8 is 0. So (2,7) is connected to (1,7), but (2,9) is not connected to any other 2s in row2. So that's a separate region. But wait, in row3, columns7-9 are 2s. So (3,9) is 2. So is (2,9) connected to (3,9)? Yes. So (2,9) is connected down to (3,9), which is part of the larger 2 region. So then the 2 at (2,9) is part of that same region. So that's included in the earlier 2 region.

Wait, let's re-examine that. The 2s in the current problem's matrix:

Row1: columns7-9: 2s.

Row2: column7 is 2, column9 is 2.

Row3: columns7-9: 2s.

So for the 2 in row2, column9: is it connected to the other 2s? The path would be: from (2,9) down to (3,9) (which is a 2), and (3,9) is connected to (3,8) and (3,7). So yes, (2,9) is part of the same region. So the entire 2 region includes all these positions. So the minimal bounding box is from row1 to row3, columns7-9. So that's correct.

Another region: in row3, column5 is 1. Wait, row3: "0100100222". So columns0-9: 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 2. So there's a 1 at (3,1) and (3,4). But the earlier 1 region includes (3,1) and (3,4). So those are part of the U-shaped 1 region. So that's covered.

Another possible region: in row2, column9 is 2, which we've already considered.

Are there any other regions?

Row7: columns5-8 are 1s. But also, rows7-9's 1s form another region. So that's another shape, color 1, with bounding box (7,5) to (9,8). But wait, this is a separate region from the earlier 1 region. Because the earlier 1 region is in rows2-4, columns1-4. This new 1 region is in rows7-9, columns5-8. So yes, separate.

Another possible region: in row3, column5 is 0. Wait, no. Let's check again.

Looking for all non-zero pixels:

Row0: all 0s.

Row1: columns7-9: 2s.

Row2: columns1-4 (1s), column7 and 9 (2s).

Row3: columns1,4 (1s), columns7-9 (2s).

Row4: columns1-4 (1s).

Row5-6: all 0s.

Row7: columns5-8 (1s).

Row8: columns5 and 8 (1s).

Row9: columns5-8 (1s).

So the non-zero pixels are:

- The U-shaped 1 region in rows2-4, columns1-4 (color 1).

- The 2 region in rows1-3, columns7-9 (color 2).

- The U-shaped 1 region in rows7-9, columns5-8 (color 1).

Are there any other regions?

Wait, in row8, column5 is 1, and row8 column8 is 1. So in row8, those 1s are connected to the 1s in row7 and 9. For example, row7's column5-8 are 1s. row8's column5 is 1, connected to row7's column5. row8's column8 is 1, connected to row7's column8. Then row9's columns5-8 are 1s. So yes, that's a connected region.

So now, we have three regions:

1. Color 1, bounding box: rows2-4 (y=2 to 4), columns1-4 (x=1-4). So top-left (2,1), width 4, height 3.

2. Color 2, bounding box: rows1-3 (y=1-3), columns7-9 (x=7-9). Top-left (1,7), width3, height3.

3. Color 1, bounding box: rows7-9 (y=7-9), columns5-8 (x=5-8). Top-left (7,5), width4, height3.

Wait, but in row7, the 1s are from column5 to 8 (indices5-8 inclusive, which is 4 columns). So width is 4. Rows7-9 is 3 rows (7,8,9). So yes.

Are there any other regions? Let's check.

Looking again at row2, column7 is 2 (part of the 2 region). What about row3, column0 is 0. All other non-zero pixels are accounted for.

So the three regions are:

A: color 1, bbox (y=2-4, x=1-4).

B: color 2, bbox (y=1-3, x=7-9).

C: color 1, bbox (y=7-9, x=5-8).

Now, we need to check if any of these regions are nested. For a child to be nested within a parent, its entire bounding box must be inside the parent's.

First, the root is the canvas (0), size 10x10 (since the matrix is 10 rows and 10 columns), so its bounding box is (0,0) to (9,9). All other regions are children of the root unless contained within another region.

Check if any of the regions are contained within others.

Region A's bbox: y 2-4 (rows 2,3,4), x 1-4 (columns1-4).

Region B's bbox: y1-3, x7-9. So region B's x7-9 is from column7 to9, which is outside of region A's x1-4. So B is not inside A.

Region C's bbox: y7-9, x5-8. Also outside of A's and B's bboxes.

So all three regions are top-level, directly under the root. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, the example 1's root had children A, B, C, which were all top-level. So yes. But maybe there's a region that is inside another.

Wait, perhaps region B's bbox is entirely within the root's bbox, but not within any other region. So B is a root child.

Same for A and C.

So in this case, the root has three children: A, B, C.

But wait, let's check the 1 regions. Are there any other regions?

Wait, looking at the matrix again, in row2, column0-9: 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 2. So region A starts at row2, column1. Its bounding box is y=2-4, x=1-4. So the pixels in this region are:

Row2: x1-4 (1s).

Row3: x1 (1), x4 (1).

Row4: x1-4 (1s).

So the minimal bounding box is indeed that. But during processing, perhaps there's another region inside this one. For example, looking at row2-4's 1s, perhaps there's a region of color 1 that is connected. But that's the same region. So no.

But what about the 0s inside the region's bounding box? Are there any other regions (non-zero) inside that?

Looking at region A's bounding box (rows2-4, x1-4), within that area:

Row2: 1 1 1 1.

Row3: 1 0 0 1.

Row4: 1 1 1 1.

The 0s in row3, x2 and x3 are part of the background. Are there any non-zero pixels in that area? No. So region A's pixels are only the 1s in that area, forming a U-shape, but the bounding box is the minimal rectangle that contains all those pixels. So the entire bounding box is considered, but the actual shape is not a solid rectangle. But according to the problem statement, each shape is a connected component of non-zero pixels, and the bounding box is the minimal rectangle that contains all pixels of the shape.

So the region's shape is not necessarily a rectangle; it's the minimal rectangle that encloses the connected pixels. So the actual shape could be any form, but the bounding box is a rectangle.

Therefore, the three regions A, B, C are all top-level, so they are children of the root. But wait, maybe region B is contained within another region. Let's see: region B's bbox is y1-3, x7-9. Is there any other region that contains this? The root's bbox (y0-9, x0-9) contains it, but no other region. So yes, B is a root child.

So the tree would be Root(A, B, C), but we need to check for possible nesting.

Wait, what about region B's color 2. Are there any regions inside B? Let's check the area of B's bbox (rows1-3, columns7-9). The pixels in this area:

Row1: 2 2 2.

Row2: 2 (column7), 0 (column8), 2 (column9).

Row3: 2 2 2.

So the connected region is the 2s in this area. But there's a 0 in row2, column8. So the actual shape is not a solid rectangle. However, the bounding box is the minimal rectangle enclosing all the 2s in this region. So in this case, there's no other non-zero pixels inside B's bounding box, except the 2s. So B has no children.

Similarly, region C's bbox (rows7-9, x5-8) contains:

Row7: 1 1 1 1.

Row8: 1 0 0 1.

Row9: 1 1 1 1.

Again, the pixels here are 1s forming a U-shape. Are there any non-zero pixels inside this area that form a separate connected region? For example, in row8, columns6-7 are 0s. So no. So region C is a single region with no children.

Region A's bbox (rows2-4, x1-4) contains:

Row2: 1 1 1 1.

Row3: 1 0 0 1.

Row4: 1 1 1 1.

Are there any non-zero pixels inside this area that form a separate region? All pixels in this area are either 1s or 0s. So no. So region A has no children.

So the tree would have the root with three children: A, B, C. But wait, looking back at the problem statement's example, the first example's root had children A, B, C, which were all top-level regions. So the infix notation would be Root(A, B, C).

But wait, in the given input matrix, the third region (C) is color 1. So in the tree, each node is represented by its color. So the root's children would be nodes with colors 1, 2, 1. However, the problem says that nodes are identified by their color and their bounding box. Wait, but the infix notation in the example uses letters (A, B, C) which are labels. However, the user's instructions say that in the infix notation, each node is represented by its color. So in the first example, the root's children are nodes labeled A, B, C, but the infix notation uses the color digits. Wait, looking at example 1's infix notation: Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)) — but in the example's structured details, the nodes have colors. So perhaps in the infix notation, the nodes are represented by their color digits. For example, the first example's infix notation is written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but in the actual output, perhaps the letters are replaced by their color digits.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation." The example 1's infix notation is written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but looking at the details:

Node A is color 2, D is color 8.

So perhaps in the infix notation, the letters are replaced by the colors. But in the example's provided infix notation, it's written as "Root(A(D), B(E), C(F))", which seems to use labels. But according to the problem statement's example, the actual infix notation for a tree like 3(2,8(1,9)) is written with the color digits. So I think the infix notation uses the color digits as node names, and if there are multiple nodes with the same color, their positions would differentiate them. However, for the purpose of the infix notation, it's the color digits, not the labels. But this may be ambiguous.

Looking back at the problem statement's first example:

The matrix has three shapes: A (color 2), B (color 1), C (color3). Then, in the infix notation, it's written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), where D is color8, E is color8, F is color8. But in the actual infix notation, perhaps these would be represented as 2(8), 1(8), 3(8), but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the infix notation uses the color digits. So the root is 0 (background), then its children are the top-level regions. Each node is represented by its color, and children are in parentheses. So for the given example in the problem, the infix notation would be 0(2(8),1(8),3(8)), but the example shows Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). So perhaps the letters are just labels, but the actual infix notation uses the colors, and the root is 0.

But the user's example 1 shows the infix notation as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), but the root's color is black (0), and the children are A (2), B (1), C (3), each of which has children (D:8, E:8, F:8). So perhaps in the infix notation, the labels are used, but the user expects the colors instead.

Wait, looking at the user's first example:

The infix notation is written as "Root(A(D), B(E), C(F))", but the structured output mentions each node's color. So perhaps the correct infix notation should use the colors. But perhaps the Root is considered as the 0 color (canvas), and its children are the top-level regions. But in the example's infix notation, the root is written as Root(...), which may imply that the root is a special node, and the children are the top-level regions. However, the problem statement says the root is the canvas (color 0). So in the infix notation, the root is 0, and its children are the top-level regions. For example, in the first example, the infix notation would be 0(2(8),1(8),3(8)), but the example shows Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). So there's a discrepancy. However, the user's example shows that the root is written as Root, and the children are labels. But according to the problem statement's instructions, the output should be the tree in infix notation using the color digits, with parentheses for children.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to represent the root as the background (color 0), and its children are the top-level regions, each represented by their color, with their children in parentheses. However, if there are multiple regions with the same color, how are they differentiated? For example, in the current problem, there are two regions with color 1. So in the infix notation, they would both appear as 1. But the problem statement's example 2 has a root with four children labeled A, B, C, D with different colors, so their infix notation is Root(A, B, C, D). But the user's example 2's infix notation is written as Root(A, B, C, D), which again uses labels. This is confusing.

Wait, the problem says: "Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation." The structured format includes details like color, position, etc., while the infix notation is a compact form. The examples show that the infix notation uses letters (A, B, C) which correspond to nodes with specific colors. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the infix notation uses the color digits, and in cases where multiple nodes have the same color, their position differentiates them, but in the infix notation, they are just listed as siblings.

But in the current problem, there are two regions with color 1 (the U-shaped region and the later U-shaped region). So in the infix notation, they would both be 1. How to handle this? The problem's examples don't have this case. For example, in example 1, each node has a unique color. But what if two nodes have the same color? How are they represented in the infix notation?

This is a potential ambiguity. However, perhaps the infix notation can have nodes with the same color as long as they are siblings. So the infix notation would list them as siblings. For example, two nodes with color 1 as siblings would be written as 1, 1.

But in the tree structure, each node is unique based on their bounding box. So in the current problem, the two 1 regions are distinct and would appear as separate children of the root.

Thus, the infix notation would be 0(1, 2, 1), where 0 is the root (canvas), and the three children are two 1s and a 2. But this may not be correct because the problem's examples use letters to differentiate nodes. However, the problem instructions state: "Output the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation. [...] Nodes without children appear alone."

The user's examples use labels (A, B, C) but the actual infix notation should use the colors. So in example 1, the infix notation is 0(2(8), 1(8), 3(8)), but in the example provided by the user, it's written as Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)). So perhaps the labels are just for explanation, and the actual infix notation uses the colors. But the user's instruction says: "In infix notation: Parentheses indicate hierarchy (nested structures). Commas separate siblings under the same parent. Nodes without children appear alone."

Therefore, in the current problem, the infix notation would be 0(1, 2, 1), but since the two 1 regions are separate siblings, this would imply two nodes with color 1. However, the problem examples use letters to represent different nodes, but perhaps the actual answer should use colors. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's identifier is its color and bounding box, but in the infix notation, the color is used. If there are multiple nodes with the same color, they are treated as separate nodes. So in the current problem, the infix notation would be 0(1, 2, 1), but this may not be correct. Alternatively, the infix notation includes the minimal information needed to represent the hierarchy, and siblings are ordered based on their position (e.g., left to right, top to bottom).

But the problem statement's examples show that the order of children in the infix notation corresponds to their positions. For example, in example 2, the infix notation is Root(A, B, C, D), which are ordered based on their positions (probably top to bottom, left to right). So for the current problem, the two 1 regions would be ordered based on their top-left positions.

Let's compare the top-left positions of the three regions:

Region A: (2,1) — row2, column1.

Region B: (1,7) — row1, column7.

Region C: (7,5) — row7, column5.

So in the order of their top-left positions (earlier rows first, then earlier columns):

B (row1) comes first, then A (row2), then C (row7). So the order would be B, A, C. But according to the problem's examples, in example 1, the children are ordered A, B, C, which are in order of their positions.

Wait, example 1's children are A, B, C. Looking at their top-left positions:

A: (1,2) — row1, column2.

B: (1,10) — row1, column10.

C: (8,8) — row8, column8.

In example 1's infix notation, they are ordered A, B, C, which is left to right based on their column positions within the same row, then top to bottom. So A and B are both in row1, so ordered by column (A is column2, B is column10, so A comes first). Then C is in row8, so comes after.

In the current problem, the three regions are:

B: row1, column7.

A: row2, column1.

C: row7, column5.

So the order would be B (earliest row), then A (row2), then C (row7). So the infix notation would be 0(2, 1, 1), but since there are two 1s, how to differentiate?

This is a problem. Because two nodes with the same color but different bounding boxes would be considered as separate nodes, but in infix notation, they are represented by their color. So the infix notation would have 0(2, 1, 1), but this implies two separate 1 nodes. However, how would one know which is which? The problem examples don't cover this case. Maybe the infix notation just lists them in order, and the structured format provides details. But according to the problem's instructions, the output should be the tree representation in both structured format and infix notation.

So, the structured format would list all nodes with their color, position, etc., and the infix notation uses their color digits. So in this case, the infix notation would be 0(2, 1, 1), but this could be ambiguous. However, the problem's examples don't have this situation, so perhaps in the context of this problem, each color is unique among siblings. But in this case, there are two regions with color 1 as siblings.

But according to the problem's hierarchy rules, a child must be fully contained within its parent. The two 1 regions are not contained within each other, so they are both children of the root. So the infix notation must list both. So perhaps the answer is 0(1, 2, 1), but ordered according to their top-left positions.

But how to order them? Let's compare their top-left positions:

Region A: (2,1) — row 2, column1.

Region B: (1,7) — row1, column7.

Region C: (7,5) — row7, column5.

The correct order would be based on the earliest row, then earliest column. So B (row1, column7) comes first. Then A (row2, column1). Then C (row7, column5). So the order is B, A, C. So the infix notation would be 0(2, 1, 1). But wait, B is color 2, A is color 1, C is color 1. So the order would be 2, then 1, then 1. So the infix notation would be 0(2, 1, 1). But this would imply that the root has three children: 2, 1, 1. But according to the structured format, each node has their own details.

But in the structured format, we have to list all nodes with their color, position, and children. So the structured format would list each region, and the infix notation would list their colors in order.

So, for the current problem:

Structured format:

Root (color 0, size 10x10, children: regions B, A, C).

Region B: color 2, bbox (1,7), width 3, height 3. No children.

Region A: color 1, bbox (2,1), width4, height3. No children.

Region C: color1, bbox (7,5), width4, height3. No children.

But according to the order based on top-left positions:

B comes first, then A, then C.

So the infix notation would be 0(2, 1, 1).

But that's two 1s as siblings. Is this acceptable?

The problem's examples don't have this case, but according to the rules, it's possible. So the answer should be in that form.

But let's double-check if any of the regions are nested. For example, is region B contained within any other region besides the root? Its bbox is rows1-3, columns7-9. The other regions' bboxes are rows2-4 (A) and rows7-9 (C). So no. So all three are root's children.

So the final answer's infix notation is 0(2, 1, 1).

But wait, the user's example 1 has three children of the root with different colors, so their infix notation is 0(2,1,3). In the current problem, two of the root's children are color 1. So the infix notation would have two 1s.

But how to represent this? The problem statement does not mention that colors are unique among siblings, so it's allowed.

Thus, the infix notation for the current problem is 0(2, 1, 1).

But let's check the matrix again to ensure that there are no other regions.

Wait, in row3, column5 is 0. So no other regions. So yes, three regions: two 1s and one 2.

But wait, in the matrix provided, the last three rows are:

Row7: 0000011110 → columns5-8 are 1s.

Row8: 0000010010 → columns5 and 8 are 1s.

Row9: 0000011110 → columns5-8 are 1s.

So the region C's bounding box is rows7-9 (y=7-9), columns5-8 (x=5-8). So yes, it's a separate region.

Thus, the conclusion is that the tree has the root (color 0) with three children: the 2 region, and two 1 regions. The infix notation is 0(2, 1, 1).

But how to order the children? The problem's examples order the children based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the children are ordered A (row1, column2), B (row1, column10), C (row8, column8). So within the same row, order by column. Otherwise, order by row.

In the current problem, the children are:

B: row1, column7 → (1,7).

A: row2, column1 → (2,1).

C: row7, column5 → (7,5).

So the order is B first (earliest row), then A (row2), then C (row7). So their colors are 2, 1, 1. So the infix notation is 0(2, 1, 1).

But this would imply that the two 1 regions are ordered by their positions. So the first 1 region is A, and the second 1 region is C.

But in the structured format, each node should be listed with their details. So the structured format would have:

Root:

- Color: 0

- Size: 10x10

- Children: B, A, C

Node B:

- Color: 2

- Bbox: top-left (1,7), width 3, height3.

- Children: None.

Node A:

- Color:1

- Bbox: (2,1), width4, height3.

- Children: None.

Node C:

- Color:1

- Bbox: (7,5), width4, height3.

- Children: None.

So in the infix notation, the order is 2 (B), then 1 (A), then 1 (C), leading to 0(2,1,1).

But according to the problem's examples, perhaps the order is based on the top-left position in a certain way, like reading order: top to bottom, left to right. So the first occurrence in the matrix is B (appearing in row1), then A (row2), then C (row7). So yes.

Thus, the final infix notation is 0(2, 1, 1).

But wait, in the problem's example 2, the infix notation is Root(A, B, C, D) which are four top-level nodes. The matrix in example2 has four regions, each with different colors (8,3,6,7), so the infix notation would be 0(8,3,6,7), but the example shows Root(A, B, C, D). So perhaps in the infix notation, the nodes are ordered based on their appearance in the matrix (top to bottom, left to right) for siblings.

So for the current problem, the order of the three regions would be based on their top-left positions, with B (row1, column7) coming before A (row2, column1) because row1 is above row2. Then C (row7, column5) comes last. So the infix notation is 0(2,1,1), with the two 1s being the regions A and C.

But the problem's instructions don't specify how to handle multiple nodes with the same color in the infix notation. However, given the examples, it's likely that they are listed as separate nodes with the same color.

Thus, the final answer's infix notation is 0(2,1,1).

Explanation:

The root (canvas, color 0) contains three top-level shapes.

Node 2 (color 2) is the first child due to its top-left position at (1, 7), followed by two Nodes 1 (color 1) in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

All nodes are siblings under the root, as none are nested within each other.
