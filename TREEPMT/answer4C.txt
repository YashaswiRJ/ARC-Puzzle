Below is one complete solution that converts the pixel matrix into a hierarchical tree structure and then represents that structure in a compact infix form.

In this example the canvas background is color 2 and the input matrix is 19 × 21. All connected regions of non‑2 pixels become shapes. One large connected block of 8’s is detected with a minimal bounding rectangle whose top‐left is at (5,6) and dimensions (6,9) (rows and columns), while each isolated 1 appears as a 1 × 1 rectangle at its respective coordinate.
Tree Representation (Structured Format)

The tree is built with the root representing the entire canvas and its children as the shapes that were detected. In a JSON‑like format the tree is represented as follows:

text
{
  "color": 2,
  "dimensions": (19, 21),
  "top_left": (0, 0),
  "children": [
    {
      "color": 8,
      "top_left": (5, 6),
      "dimensions": (6, 9),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (1, 7),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (2, 2),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (2, 17),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (3, 13),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (7, 19),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (9, 2),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (13, 17),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "color": 1,
      "top_left": (17, 1),
      "dimensions": (1, 1),
      "children": []
    }
  ]
}

Each child node is a non‑background shape (color 8 or 1) that lies entirely within the bounds of the canvas.
Infix Notation

The tree is then compressed into infix notation by writing the root node’s color followed by its children in parentheses and separated by commas. In the notation the nodes without children appear simply as their color number. For the structured tree above the infix notation is:

text
2(8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

This notation compactly represents that the canvas (color 2) has nine children – the large color-8 shape followed by eight isolated color-1 shapes.

This complete answer shows both the structured tree and its infix notation, matching the rules and examples provided for hierarchical decomposition of the pixel matrix.
