Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pixel matrix into a tree using infix notation. The background color here is '2', so the canvas is color 2. The matrix is 19 rows by 21 columns, right? Let's start by identifying all the connected regions that are not background (so color not 2). Then, determine their bounding boxes and hierarchy based on containment.

First, scan through the matrix to find all non-2 regions. Let's look at each cell.

Looking at row 1 (0-indexed?), probably not. Let me check the input matrix again. The user provided the matrix as:

The first line is 22 2's. Then, the second line has a '1' in the middle. Let's see:

Row 1 (assuming rows start from 0) might be the second line: "222222222122222222222". The '1' is at position (1,9) perhaps? Let me count the characters. The first row is 21 characters? Wait, the input matrix lines:

First line: "222222222222222222222" which is 21 characters. So each row is 21 characters, and there are 19 rows. So the matrix is 19x21.

Looking for non-2 digits. Let's go row by row.

Row 0: all 2s.

Row 1: positions 0-20. The string is "222222222122222222222". So at column 9, there's a '1'.

Row 2: "221222222222222221222" — two '1's here? At column 2 and 18.

Row 3: "222222222222212222222" — there's a '1' at column 13.

Row 4: all 2s.

Rows 5-10: Check for the '8's. Let's see:

Row 5: "222222288888888222222" — columns 6-13 are 8s.

Row 6: same as row 5.

Row 7: "222222288888888222222" — same 8s. Then row 8: "222222288888888222212" — ends with a '1' and a '2'?

Wait, row 8's string is "222222288888888222212" — so at column 17 there's a '1'?

Wait the original input:

For row 7: "222222288888888222212" — no, maybe I should recheck the input as given. Let me re-examine the user's input matrix:

The user wrote:

222222222222222222222

222222222122222222222

221222222222222221222

222222222222212222222

222222222222222222222

222222288888888222222

222222288888888222222

222222288888888222212

222222288888888222222

221222288888888222222

222222288888888222222

222222222222222222222

222222222222222222222

222222222222222122222

222222222222222222222

222222222222222222222

222222222222222222222

222122222221222222222

222222222222222222222

Wait, perhaps each line is 21 characters. Let's parse each row:

Row 0: 21 '2's.

Row 1: 9th character (0-based?) is '1'. Let's see: "222222222122222222222" — positions 0-20. So the '1' is at column 9.

Row 2: "221222222222222221222" — columns 2 and 18 are '1's.

Row 3: "222222222222212222222" — column 13 is '1'.

Row 5: "222222288888888222222" — columns 6-13 are '8's (from 6 to 13 inclusive is 8 characters? Let's count: 2222222 (7 2's), then 88888888 (8 8's?), but the string is 21 characters. Let's see: 222222 (6 2's), then 8... Maybe let me count:

Row 5: "222222" (6) + "88888888" (8) + "222222" (7?), wait total length would be 6+8+7=21. So columns 6 to 13 (inclusive) are 8's.

Similarly, rows 5,6,7,8,9,10 have the 8's. Let's check:

Row 5: columns 6-13: 8's.

Row 6: same.

Row 7: same, but the ending is "222212". So columns 17 is '1', then '2's. So in row 7 (assuming it's the 8th row, 0-based index 7), the row is "222222288888888222212" — columns 6-13 are 8's, then columns 17 is '1'.

Row 8: "222222288888888222222" — columns 6-13 8's.

Row 9: "221222288888888222222" — columns 6-13 8's, and column 2 is '1'.

Row 10: same as row 5-8, 8's in columns 6-13.

Then rows 11-12: all 2's.

Row 13: "222222222222222122222" — column 14 is '1'.

Row 14-16: all 2's.

Row 17: "222122222221222222222" — columns 3 and 10 are '1's.

Row 18: all 2's.

So the non-2 regions are:

1. The '1's in various positions. Let's list all the positions of '1's:

Row 1, column 9: 1.

Row 2, columns 2 and 18: 1's.

Row 3, column 13: 1.

Row 7, column 17: 1.

Row 9, column 2: 1.

Row 13, column 14: 1.

Row 17, columns 3 and 10: 1's.

Additionally, the big 8 region spanning rows 5-10 (0-based?), columns 6-13. So the 8's form a large rectangle.

Wait, but first, the 8's: from row 5 to row 10 (inclusive?), and columns 6 to 13 (inclusive). Let's confirm:

Looking at the matrix:

Rows 5-10 (0-based? Let's see: the fifth line after the first is row 5? Let's index from 0:

Row 0: all 2's.

Row 1: 222222222122222222222.

Row 2: 221222222222222221222.

Row3: 222222222222212222222.

Row4: all 2's.

Row5: 222222288888888222222.

Row6: same as row5.

Row7: 222222288888888222212.

Row8: 222222288888888222222.

Row9: 221222288888888222222.

Row10: 222222288888888222222.

So rows 5-10 (indices 5 to 10, inclusive) have the 8's. Each of these rows has 8's from columns 6 to 13. For example, row5's string is "222222288888888222222". The 8's start after the 6th 2 (so index 6) and run for 8 characters, until index 13 (since 6+7=13, maybe). So each row from 5 to 10 has 8's in columns 6-13. That's 6 rows (rows5-10 inclusive) and 8 columns (6-13 inclusive). So the 8's form a 6x8 rectangle starting at (5,6) if rows and columns are 0-based. Wait, row5 is index5, columns6-13 (0-based) are 8 digits. So the 8's region is from row5 to row10 (6 rows), column6 to column13 (8 columns). So the minimal bounding box is top-left at (5,6), dimensions 6x8. This is a big region of 8's.

Then, there are the 1's. Let's check each 1 and see if they form connected regions. But the 1's are all single cells except maybe some adjacent ones.

Wait, looking at the positions of 1's:

Row1: column9. Check if adjacent to any other 1's. No, because neighboring cells are 2's except perhaps row0 and row2, but row0 is all 2's. So this 1 is isolated.

Row2: columns2 and 18. The one at column2 is in row2, column2. Adjacent cells: row2, column1 is 2, row2 column3 is 2 (row2's string is "221222222222222221222" — so column0 is 2, column1 is 2, column2 is 1, column3 is 2. So this 1 is a single cell. Similarly, the 1 at column18 is in row2. The next column (19) is 2, and row3's column18 is 2. So isolated.

Row3: column13. Check adjacent cells. Row3's string is "222222222222212222222". The '1' is at column13. Columns12 is 2, column14 is 2. Row4's column13 is 2. So this 1 is a single cell.

Row7: column17. The row is "222222288888888222212". So column17 is 1. Adjacent cells: row7, column16 is 2, column18 is 2. Row8's column17 is 2. So isolated.

Row9: column2. Row9's string is "221222288888888222222". So column2 is 1. Adjacent cells: row9, column1 is 2, column3 is 2. Row8's column2 is 2. So isolated.

Row13: column14. The row is "222222222222222122222". So column14 is 1. Adjacent cells are 2's. Isolated.

Row17: columns3 and 10. Let's see. Row17's string is "222122222221222222222". So columns3 is 1 (0-based?), and column10 is 1. So two separate 1's here. Column3: adjacent cells are row17, column2 (2), column4 (2). Row16's column3 is 2. So isolated. Column10: adjacent cells are row17, column9 (2), column11 (2). So isolated.

So all the 1's are single-cell regions. The 8's form a large rectangle. Now, the hierarchy.

The root is the canvas, which is color 2, size 19x21. Its children are all the top-level regions (non-nested). Now, the 8's are a region. Are any of the 1's inside the 8's region's bounding box?

The 8's bounding box is rows5-10 (inclusive), columns6-13 (inclusive). Let's check the positions of the 1's:

Row1: (1,9). Is 1 within 5-10 rows? No, row1 is less than 5, so outside. So this 1 is in the canvas.

Row2's 1's: (2,2) and (2,18). Row2 is 2, which is less than 5, so outside the 8's region. So those 1's are in the canvas.

Row3's 1 at (3,13): row3 is less than 5, so outside.

Row7's 1 is at (7,17). The 8's region's columns are 6-13. 17 is outside, so this 1 is in the canvas.

Row9's 1 is at (9,2). 2 is less than 6 (columns6-13), so this 1 is in row9, column2, which is outside the 8's bounding box (columns6-13). Wait, row9 is part of the 8's region (rows5-10), but column2 is outside the 8's columns. So this 1 is in the canvas.

Row13's 1 is (13,14). The 8's region ends at row10, so row13 is outside. So this is in the canvas.

Row17's 1's are (17,3) and (17,10). Both in rows after 10, so in canvas.

So the 8's region is a child of the canvas. Now, the 1's are all in the canvas. So the root (canvas) has children: the 8's region and all the 1's. Wait, but how many nodes are there? Each connected non-zero region (non-2) is a node. The 8's region is one node. The 1's are 8 separate nodes (since each is a single cell and not connected). Wait, let me count the number of 1's:

Row1: 1.

Row2: 2.

Row3:1.

Row7:1.

Row9:1.

Row13:1.

Row17:2.

Total of 8 1's. Each is a separate region. So the root has 8+1=9 children: the 8's region and the 8 1's. But wait, no: the 8's region is a single region. Each 1 is a separate region.

But wait, the 8's region is a rectangle. Are there any other non-2 regions besides the 8's and the 1's? The 8's are the only non-2 besides the 1's. So the root's children are the 8's region plus all the 1's. But that would be 9 children. But some 1's may be inside the 8's region's bounding box?

Wait, let's check each 1's position against the 8's region's bounding box. The 8's region is from row5 to 10 (inclusive), columns6-13 (inclusive). Let's see:

Row7's 1 is at (7,17). The 8's region's columns are 6-13. 17 is outside. So outside.

Row9's 1 is at (9,2). Column2 is outside the 8's columns. So outside.

Row5-10: the 8's region. Any 1's in rows5-10 and columns6-13? Let's check:

Looking at rows5-10:

Row5: 222222288888888222222 → no 1's.

Row6: same as row5.

Row7: 222222288888888222212 → columns6-13 are 8's. The '1' is at column17, outside.

Row8: same as row5 in 8's region.

Row9: 221222288888888222222 → in columns6-13: 8's. The '1' is at column2, outside.

Row10: same as row5.

So all the 1's are outside the 8's region's bounding box. Therefore, the 8's region is a child of the root (canvas), and all the 8 1's are also children of the root, because their bounding boxes are not contained within any other region except the root.

Wait, but the hierarchy rules say that a child must be fully contained within the parent's bounding box. So the 8's region's bounding box is rows5-10, columns6-13. Any of the 1's that are inside this box would be children of the 8's node. But according to their positions, none of the 1's are inside this box. Let's check each 1:

Row1: (1,9). Rows5-10? No. So outside.

Row2: (2,2) and (2,18). No.

Row3: (3,13). Row3 is outside 5-10.

Row7: (7,17). Column17 is outside 6-13.

Row9: (9,2). Column2 is outside.

Row13: (13,14). Row13 is outside.

Row17: (17,3) and (17,10). Both rows are outside.

So none of the 1's are within the 8's bounding box. Therefore, the root node (canvas) has 9 children: the 8's region and the 8 1's. But wait, that would be 1 (8's) + 8 (1's) = 9 children. However, in the example given in the problem statement, the infix notation was Root(A(D), B(E), C(F)), meaning the root's children are A, B, C, each of which may have their own children. So in our case, the root would have 9 children. But how to order them in the infix notation. However, the problem states that the hierarchy is determined by containment. Since none of the 1's are contained within the 8's region, all 9 regions are direct children of the root.

But wait, the 8's region is a rectangle of 6 rows x8 columns. Are there any other regions contained within the 8's region? For example, are there any regions (like other 8's?) No, because the 8's region is a single connected region. So the 8's region has no children. All 1's are separate.

Wait, but all the 1's are separate. So each 1 is a separate node, each with their own bounding box (which is a 1x1 rectangle at their position). The 8's region is another node. So the root (canvas) has 9 children. But the problem says that children are ordered such that those with higher z-index (i.e., appearing later in the matrix processing) are siblings. Wait, but how is the z-index determined? The problem says: children always have a higher z-index than their parent. So overlapping regions: child's color takes precedence. But in this case, none of the regions overlap. Because the 8's region is in rows5-10, columns6-13, and the 1's are all outside. So the root's children are the 8's region and the 8 1's. Each of these is a node. Now, the infix notation would be Root(8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Wait, but how to order the siblings? Because the problem's examples ordered them as Root(A, B, C, D), but the letters are arbitrary. But the problem says that in infix notation, naming should not be based on colors to avoid confusion. Wait, but the examples used letters. So in our case, we need to assign names to each node (like A, B, C, etc.) in the infix notation, but the actual color is part of the node's details.

Wait, the problem says: "Naming in infix notation should not be done based on colors to avoid confusion." So the letters are arbitrary identifiers, not based on color. So the root's children are ordered in some way, perhaps based on the order in which the regions are processed (e.g., top to bottom, left to right). But how to determine the order for the infix notation? The problem examples ordered the children in the order they appear, perhaps in the order they are found. So for our case, perhaps the 8's region is processed first (since it's larger, or earlier in the matrix), then the 1's in the order of their positions. But the exact order may not matter as long as the hierarchy is correct.

But for the purpose of this problem, the key is to correctly identify the hierarchy. Since all the 1's and the 8's are children of the root, the infix notation would be Root(8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), but since the 8's region is one node and there are 8 1's, that's 9 children. However, in the input matrix, there are 8 1's? Let me count again:

Row1: 1 (count 1)

Row2: 2 (count 3)

Row3: 1 (count4)

Row7:1 (count5)

Row9:1 (count6)

Row13:1 (count7)

Row17:2 (count9)

Wait, row17 has two 1's. So total 1's: 1 + 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 +2 = 9? Let's recount:

Row1: 1 → 1.

Row2: two 1's → 3.

Row3: 1 →4.

Row7:1 →5.

Row9:1 →6.

Row13:1 →7.

Row17: two →9.

Yes, total of 9 1's. So the root has 10 children: the 8's region and 9 1's. Wait no, wait the 8's region is one node, and 9 1's. So 10 children. Wait but that can't be. Let's recount the 1's:

Row1: 1.

Row2: two.

Row3: one.

Row7: one.

Row9: one.

Row13: one.

Row17: two.

Total: 1+2+1+1+1+1+2 =9. Yes, nine 1's. Plus the 8's region. So 10 children.

Wait, no: the 8's region is one node. The 1's are nine nodes. So total of 10 children. But that's a lot.

But according to the problem statement, each distinct connected non-zero region is a node. So each 1 is a separate node if they are not connected. Since each 1 is isolated, they are all separate nodes. So the root has 1 (8's) +9 (1's) =10 children.

But how to represent this in infix notation. For example, the infix notation would be Root(8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) if all the 1's are children. However, since the 8's region is a larger rectangle, but not containing any of the 1's, all are siblings.

Now, the next step is to represent each node's attributes. For example, the 8's region has color 8, bounding box from row5 to 10 (inclusive) → 6 rows, columns6-13 (8 columns). So top-left is (5,6), dimensions 6x8. The 1's are each 1x1, with their positions. So for example, the first 1 in row1, column9: top-left (1,9), size 1x1.

So the tree would have the root (canvas color 2, size 19x21) with children:

- 8 (bounding box (5,6), 6x8)

- 1 (bounding box (1,9), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (2,2), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (2,18), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (3,13), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (7,17), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (9,2), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (13,14), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (17,3), 1x1)

- 1 (bounding box (17,10), 1x1)

But the problem says that in infix notation, the nodes are named with letters, not colors. So the root would have children A (8's region), B (1), C (another 1), etc. However, since all the 1's are separate nodes, they would all be siblings.

But how to order them in the infix notation. The problem examples ordered them based on their positions. For example, in example1, the children were ordered A, B, C which corresponded to the order in which they appeared (left to right, top to bottom). So perhaps in this case, the children are ordered based on their top-left positions. The order is determined by their position in the matrix, starting from top-left to bottom-right. So the earliest (smallest row, then column) comes first.

So to list the children in order:

1. 8's region: top-left (5,6)

2. 1 at (1,9)

3. 1 at (2,2)

4. 1 at (2,18)

5. 1 at (3,13)

6. 1 at (7,17)

7. 1 at (9,2)

8. 1 at (13,14)

9. 1 at (17,3)

10. 1 at (17,10)

But according to the order of their positions. For example, row comes first. So the earliest in row 1 comes first. Then row2, etc. So the first child after the 8's region (assuming the 8's region's top-left is (5,6), which is row5) is the 1 at (1,9) (row1, column9), which is earlier. Wait, but the 8's region is at row5, which is later than row1. So in the order of processing, the earliest regions (topmost) are processed first. So the 1's in row1 would come before the 8's region. Wait, but the 8's region is in row5. So perhaps the children are ordered by their top-left position, with row as the primary key and column as secondary. So regions with higher row (lower in the matrix) come after those with lower row.

Wait, but the problem examples suggest that the largest enclosing shape is the root's first child. For example, in example1, the root has three children A, B, C, which were the largest enclosing shapes. Wait, no. In example1, the root is the canvas, which is the entire matrix, and its children are the shapes not nested within any other shape. So the root's children are all the top-level shapes. But their order in the infix notation is determined by their positions. So perhaps the order is based on their top-left position: first the shape with the smallest row, then smallest column.

So for the current problem, the 8's region starts at (5,6), while the first 1 is at (1,9). So the order of the children would be:

1. 1 at (1,9) → row1, column9.

Then the next shape would be the 1 at (2,2), then (2,18), (3,13), (5,6) (the 8's region comes here?), (7,17), (9,2), (13,14), (17,3), (17,10).

Wait, but the 8's region's top-left is (5,6). So comparing to the other positions:

The 1 at (1,9) comes first (row1 < row5).

Then (2,2) row2 < row5.

Then (2,18) same row.

Then (3,13) row3 <5.

Then (5,6) comes after (3,13). Then (7,17) row7, which is after row5.

So the order would be:

1. (1,9)

2. (2,2)

3. (2,18)

4. (3,13)

5. (5,6)

6. (7,17)

7. (9,2)

8. (13,14)

9. (17,3)

10. (17,10)

Wait, but the 8's region's top-left is (5,6). So in the list of top-left positions, this would come after the 1's in row1, 2,3, and before the 1's in row7,9, etc.

So the children of the root would be ordered as:

1. The 1 at (1,9)

2. 1 at (2,2)

3. 1 at (2,18)

4. 1 at (3,13)

5. 8's region at (5,6)

6. 1 at (7,17)

7. 1 at (9,2)

8. 1 at (13,14)

9. 1 at (17,3)

But perhaps the 8's region is considered as a single node and is processed after the 1's that are above it. But the exact order depends on how the regions are detected. For example, if we process the matrix row by row, left to right, then the first non-2 cell is row1, column9 (the first 1). Then row2, column2, then row2, column18, etc. The 8's region starts at row5, column6. So in the processing order, the 1's in rows1-3 would be detected first, then the 8's region, then the 1's in row7, etc.

Therefore, the order of the children would be the 1's in row1, then row2, then row3, then the 8's region (row5), then the 1's in row7,9,13,17.

But the exact order depends on the algorithm's traversal. For the purpose of this problem, the exact order of siblings in the infix notation may not matter as long as the hierarchy is correct. However, the problem's examples ordered the children in the order they were found. So perhaps the correct approach is to list the children in the order they are discovered during a row-major traversal (row by row, left to right).

Let's imagine processing the matrix row by row, left to right, and for each cell, if it's a new region (not part of any already processed region), then add it as a new node.

In this case:

Row0: all 2's.

Row1: column9 is 1. So first region is the 1 at (1,9). Then, as the matrix is scanned left to right, this is the first non-2 cell encountered. So node A is this 1.

Row2: column2 is 1. Next non-2 cell is (2,2). Node B. Then, column18 is 1. Node C.

Row3: column13 is 1. Node D.

Row5: columns6-13 are 8's. So the entire 8's region is discovered. This is node E.

Then row7, column17: 1. Node F.

Row9: column2: 1. Node G.

Row13: column14: 1. Node H.

Row17: column3: 1. Node I. Column10: 1. Node J.

So total of 10 children (A-J), where A is (1,9), B (2,2), C(2,18), D(3,13), E(5,6), F(7,17), G(9,2), H(13,14), I(17,3), J(17,10).

Thus, the infix notation would be Root(E, A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J). Wait, no. Because the order of processing is row by row. The 8's region is first encountered at row5, which comes after the 1's in rows1-3. So the first nodes discovered are A, B, C, D, then E (the 8's region), then F, G, H, I, J.

So the children order would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Because A is processed first (row1), then B (row2), C (row2), D (row3), E (row5), etc.

But the 8's region spans rows5-10, so when processing row5, columns6-13 are 8's. This is the first occurrence of the 8's, so this is the start of the region. So node E is the 8's region. So the root's children are ordered in the sequence they are discovered: A (row1), B (row2), C (row2), D (row3), E (row5), F (row7), G (row9), H (row13), I (row17), J (row17).

But when processing row5, the 8's region is encountered. Since it's a large rectangle, but all the 8's are connected. So node E is the 8's region, added when the first cell of it is found. So the order of the children would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Thus, the infix notation would be Root(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), where each letter represents a node. But according to the problem's examples, the children are ordered in the infix notation as siblings separated by commas, enclosed in the root's parentheses.

So the final infix notation would be Root(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), with E being the 8's region, and A-J being the 1's and E.

But each node's color is part of their attributes. So in the structured format, each node is described with color, bounding box, etc.

So putting it all together:

Root Node:

- Color: '2' (background)

- Size: 19x21

- Children: 10 nodes (A-J as described)

Each 1's node:

- Color: '1'

- Shape: Rectangle (1x1)

- Top-left: their respective positions

- Blueprint: '1'

The 8's node:

- Color: '8'

- Shape: Rectangle 6x8

- Top-left: (5,6)

- Blueprint: 8x8 in each row (but dimensions 6 rows x8 columns)

Thus, the infix notation would list all the root's children in the order they were discovered during processing (row-major order), leading to Root(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), where:

A: (1,9) 1x1 '1'

B: (2,2) 1x1 '1'

C: (2,18) 1x1 '1'

D: (3,13) 1x1 '1'

E: (5,6) 6x8 '8'

F: (7,17) 1x1 '1'

G: (9,2) 1x1 '1'

H: (13,14) 1x1 '1'

I: (17,3) 1x1 '1'

J: (17,10) 1x1 '1'

All these are direct children of the root, as none are nested within each other.

So the final infix notation is Root(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), where each letter represents a node with their respective details.

Infix Notation:
Root(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J)

Explanation:

The root represents the entire canvas (color '2') with 10 top-level children.

Node E (color '8') is the large rectangle nested directly under the root.

Nodes A-J (color '1') are single-cell regions, all siblings under the root.

No nested hierarchies exist beyond the root, as no child is fully contained within another’s bounding box.
